# Future Oceans
In 2015, Internewsâ€™ Earth Journalism Network (EJN) commissioned a series of stories that explored disruptive innovations likely to affect marine conservation, providing a multi-dimensional, global look at the technologies, policies, and people that are creating a new future for the world's oceans.

Stories were published using WordPress and the [JEO Newsroom theme](https://github.com/EarthJournalismNetwork/JEO-Newsroom). In 2020, the website was flattened and all the content was uploaded to this repository. The domain FutureOceans.org is now pointing to this repository via GitHub Pages.
