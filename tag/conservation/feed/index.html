								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People love the ocean. Science has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Mind-Surprising-Healthier-Connected/dp/0316252085/">shown</a> it. But do they value it?</p>
<p>Not enough, ocean advocates would say. Or at the very least, the love we humans have for the oceans is not reflected in our collective behavior and our policies. Otherwise, the oceans would not be in the damaged state we find them today, their fish stocks depleted, coral reefs degraded and waters debased by all manner of garbage and pollutants.</p>

<p>In purely monetary terms, economists have estimated the total value of the ecosystem services provided by the oceans at around <a href="http://awsassets.wwf.org.au/downloads/mo036_reviving_the_ocean_economy_23apr15.pdf">$24 trillion</a>. If they were a country, the oceans would have the seventh largest economy on the planet, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/total-value-earths-ocean-24-trillion-its-falling-fast-wwf-1893415">according</a> to Ove Hoegh-Guldberg of the University of Queensland. But this value is declining rapidly as they become more exploited and further polluted. To cite just one statistic, a <a href="http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/living_planet_index2/">new report</a> states that marine species have declined by 39% between 1970 and 2010.</p>
<p>How can we communicate the value of the oceans in a way that gets the public and policy-makers to act more responsibly? It’s a puzzle that activists, scientists, journalists and indeed anyone who loves the ocean have been pondering with limited success.</p>
<p>In the future, say some ecologists and social marketing experts, the answer could well be informed by some relatively new scientific disciplines. Emerging fields such as neuroscience, behavioral psychology, even new understandings in evolutionary theory may augment the way we communicate about the oceans. In particular, say some advocates, calls for marine protection need to be more emotionally focused, at least in wealthy societies, and based more on appeals to group identity as the messages are spread to the developing world.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it is technology that will make the difference. Could the advent of social media, or the spread of some next generation tool such as virtual reality change public awareness about the oceans? Then again, the answer could be much simpler, and may lie in better understanding and adopting the science of narrative structure to ocean communications.</p>
<p>To see where we’re going, we first need to see where we’re at. There is significant skepticism about the efficacy of current efforts to communicate about the oceans, which these days tend to combine the dissemination of basic information with some mixture of fear, hope and wonder.</p>
<h2><strong>A Growing Sea of Media</strong></h2>
<p>While our fascination with the oceans probably goes back to the time humanity’s evolutionary forebears crawled from the sea, most experts you talk to about modern communications usually begin by referring to Jacques Cousteau. One of the pioneers of nature programming on TV, he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau">helped produce</a> more than 120 documentaries about the ocean (and over 50 books), which were a huge influence on those of us who grew up in the 1960s and 70s watching shows such as <em>The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau.</em></p>
<p>Given how remote and unseen most ocean life is to the average person, these efforts to communicate marine science are even more vital than for other environmental issues. Today, there are more beautifully shot ocean documentaries available than ever, many of them containing striking high-definition footage of the wonders of the deep.</p>
<p>The number of marine parks, aquariums and marine life centers has also steadily grown, offering more opportunities for the public to learn about and explore the oceans and their inhabitants. “It’s so hard to see what’s going on beneath the surface of the ocean. That’s why aquariums play such a powerful role, they have emotional impact on audiences,” says Nancy Baron of COMPASS, which works with scientists to help them communicate. “Places like the Monterey Bay Aquarium have done so much, because people have an emotional experience from what they’re seeing.”</p>

<p>Journalism continues to produce some profound reporting that help the public to understand how the oceans are changing. Writers such as <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-altered-oceans-sg-20060730-storygallery.html">Kenneth R. Weiss</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Carl-Safina/e/B000APJCLI/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1444322997&amp;sr=1-2-ent">Carl Safina</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/David-Helvarg/e/B001K7PU34/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1444322896&amp;sr=1-2-ent">David Helvarg</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paul-Greenberg/e/B001H6J2I2/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1444322855&amp;sr=1-2-ent">Paul Greenberg</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Charles-Clover/e/B001JP4M36/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1">Charles Clover</a> and most recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/24/world/the-outlaw-ocean.html">Ian Urbina</a> have produced ground-breaking books and series on marine topics.</p>
<p>And scientists such as Sylvia Earle, Jeremy Jackson and Daniel Pauly are also working as communicators to help the public understand these issues. Ben Halpern, a researcher at UC Santa Barbara, has created the <a href="http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/">Ocean Health Index</a>, an innovative ranking system that Baron believes can help policy-makers by providing a comprehensive assessment of the state of the oceans through a relatively simple framework.</p>
<p>But there is reason to question the effectiveness of many of these approaches. Aquariums, for instance, can be expensive to visit, and marine life centers are now subject to criticism for holding marine mammals (among other species) in captivity. Journalists and scientists remain hugely important in their ability to uncover hidden trends and scandals, and to reach out to audiences beyond those who already care. But their voices are becoming increasingly diluted in the growing sea of media and entertainment options.</p>
<p>And those beautiful documentaries may not be having as much of an impact as we’d like to think on the public. “Jacques Cousteau tried to set a good example for the telling of compelling stories, but when he exited there was no one to pick up the mantle,” argues Randy Olson, a scientist turned film-maker.</p>
<p>Could advances in media technology come to the rescue? Perhaps the most obvious potential lies in the digital media revolution we’re currently witnessing. In particular, social media has greatly decentralized (or “disintermediated”) the way information is spread about the oceans and other current affairs, and has had a major impact on the way the public consumes news, opinion and information.</p>
<p>This has enabled NGOs and scientists to reach out directly to the public, without having to work through professional journalists. And campaigners are entranced by the possibility of having their messages go viral. They point to examples like the “Under the Dome” documentary on air pollution in China which reached hundreds of millions of people (before being shut down by the government), or the recent outcry spurred by the killing of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1kHXaW88yhs?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;w=560&amp;h=315" height="315" width="100%"></iframe></p>
<p>But skeptics question whether this may be fool’s gold. “I think much more relevant to Cecil than any­ change of collective conscience is to look at the KONY 2012 event — another example of social media going nuts over having found a clear and pure devil,” says Olson. “It’s much more about the unifying power of hatred than anything so uplifting as protecting nature.”</p>
<p>Equally enticing is the ability to spread information through mobile phones, and what’s more, to collect data. “We have already seen mobile technology play a role in some of our campaigns,” confirms Brooke Sadowsky of the group <a href="http://www.rare.org/">RARE</a>, which runs social marketing campaigns on environmental themes.<br />
“We can send out reminders about hunting seasons, for instance, or have volunteers carry out reporting activities.”</p>
<p>Local partners of Internews’ Earth Journalism Network<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> (EJN) in <a href="http://internews.org/our-stories/press/sos-sms">Indonesia</a> and the <a href="http://internews.org/our-stories/project-updates/local-journalists-philippines-use-sms-get-information-their-communities">Philippines</a> have used SMS networks to collect data and report on illegal activities, such as encroachment by loggers in the forests of <a href="http://internews.org/our-stories/program-news/new-media-empower-local-communities-indonesia">Kalimantan</a>. “Most of our target audience don’t have access to smart phones yet, but they can certainly play a big role in the future,” adds RARE’s Sadowsky. “There are major opportunities to create apps and games that can support the messages and norms we’re trying to spread.”</p>

<p>Data journalism is another fast-growing segment of the media world, and has been building on the huge amounts of environmental data available to the public. EJN has again worked with local partners to create a series of <a href="http://www.geojournalism.org">GeoJournalism</a> sites that combine interactive maps, visualized data and traditional journalism to shed new light on crucial regions such as the <a href="http://www.infoamazonia.org/">Amazon</a>, the <a href="http://www.infocongo.org">Congo Basin</a> and the <a href="http://www.thethirdpole.net">Himalayas</a>.</p>
<p>So far, only the <a href="http://www.ekuatorial.com">Ekuatorial</a> platform in Indonesia has focused on ocean issues, providing maps of marine protected areas, biodiversity zones and close-to-real-time marine traffic. Given how hard it is to get solid information about what’s going on at sea, if journalists or scientists can find ways to display visualized data from satellites, underwater probes and other forms of remote sensing, it has real potential to keep the public and policy-makers updated with crucial information about the oceans.</p>
<h2><strong>Virtual Oceans</strong></h2>
<p>Perhaps the most enticing media advance on the horizon is virtual reality. Imagine if you could enjoy the experience of diving at a remote, pristine coral reef in the comfort of your living room without the hefty price tag? It could potentially provide access to the wonders of the deep in a way that even IMAX films and aquariums couldn’t match.</p>
<p>Actually, most ocean communicators seem <a href="https://medium.com/@cartelmike/why-vr-storytelling-does-not-currently-work-and-can-it-ever-work-728ff15efb1c#.t3h7opr17">skeptical</a> that advances in media technology could have a significant impact on the public’s relationship with the oceans, or on their support for ocean conservation. Indeed, it could conceivably have the reverse affect if people come to feel it’s no longer as necessary to protect marine sanctuaries once they’re captured in virtual reality. But some are intrigued by the possibilities of this new technology.</p>
<p>“From what I’ve heard, I would think experiencing the oceans in virtual reality would help. It could show a pristine environment and then a damaged one,” suggests John Baker managing director of <a href="http://www.wildaid.org">Wild Aid</a>, which is working to stem the illegal wildlife trade. “Perhaps there could be a virtual aquarium, like a planetarium, that we could show to local communities. Maybe they can put some of that technology into schools.”</p>

(Credit: Ms. SmittyB/Flickr)</p></div>
<p>“There’s a chance it could have a popular impact,” adds Baron. “We have to try every avenue. One size does not fit all.” Perhaps it could help address the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_baseline">shifting baselines</a> problem that environmentalists bemoan, in which the public doesn’t realize the natural treasures being lost because they’ve only experienced a diminished world.</p>
<p>“The potential is there with virtual reality,” says ocean ecologist Wallace J Nichols. “But it would be a continuation of the technology we have now. We already have a lot of high-definition, 3D images of nature that most people have never seen. We know a movie is pre-filtered, manufactured. It’s different from something that’s un-scripted. There’s something about the multi-sensory experience that makes memories into nostalgia, that creates memory packed with emotion.</p>
<p>“Movies can do that but it’s rare. There’s always hype that ‘this movie is going to be world-changing’, but then people walk out and it’s relatively quickly forgotten. Rarely do you meet a conservationist who says she or he chose this career because of an IMAX movie. People fall in love with a reality-based experience.</p>
<p>“So virtual reality would be interesting, but not quite awe-inducing, not transformative. Maybe there’s a technological leap that suddenly makes it more impactful. But moving through real space and time and using all your senses still beats that. I’d still prefer to jump into an ocean for 15 seconds than watch a film.”</p>
<h2><strong>More Honest, Less Earnest</strong></h2>
<p>Olson, the communications critic who is coming out with a new book called <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo21174162.html"><em>Houston, We Have a Narrative: Why Science Needs Story</em></a>, puts it this way: “New technology is still only about style.  What is needed is more focus on substance — meaning figuring out the narrative dynamics — which means identifying the large scale solutions, then figuring out how to communicate them efficiently in a manner that is not boring or confusing.  Unfortunately the people responsible for this haven’t yet cracked that nut yet.</p>
<p>“If you want to know how bad ocean communication is, just go to any ocean film festival. The films are painfully dull and repetitive. There is a lack of understanding, interest and capability for storytelling, as well as a lack of understanding of entertainment in general.”</p>
<p>Olson argues that there is a similar problem in the communication of ocean science. “Even today it is very hard to get a clear picture of whether world fisheries are collapsing or stable, and of just how dire the picture is for coral reefs. Earlier this year, <a href="http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/12/24/biosci.biu198">a paper on ‘ocean calamities’</a> from Carlos Duarte suggested that some scientists have overstated the problems. It sparked a lot of controversy and indignation, along with a <a href="http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/65/8/745.full?keytype=ref&amp;ijkey=fSLsWtF70U5Xfgz">rebuttal</a> led by [NYU environmental studies professor] Jennifer Jacquet. But they hit on some truths. It’s a narrative mess.”</p>
<p>In short, he believes ocean communications needs to be more honest and less earnest. “The best hope is to propagate a wider understanding of the importance of having ‘narrative intuition’,” he claims. “There is a science to narrative. It needs to be brought to bear on ocean conservation issues.”</p>
<p>New York Times <a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/">DotEarth</a> blogger Andrew Revkin agrees with Olson that the “formula” many conservation groups use in their communications is confusing and even counter-productive. “You can&#8217;t say the world is ending and point to simple fixes at the same time,” he contends. “You can say things we care about, like coral reefs, are at risk and there are ways to cut those risks. But how do you engage disengaged audiences on that? What would the perfect film on conservation in the Anthropocene look like?”</p>
<p>Perhaps the best recent example of an effective communications campaign has been the work carried out by Wild Aid in China, which has been widely praised in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-china-victory-for-wildlife-conservation-as-citizens-persuaded-to-give-up-shark-fin-soup/2013/10/19/e8181326-3646-11e3-89db-8002ba99b894_story.html">helping to reduce the consumption</a> of shark fins. The group <a href="http://wildaid.org/sites/default/files/resources/SharkReport_Evidence%20of%20Declines%20in%20Shark%20Fin%20Demand_China.pdf">claims</a> that there has been an “82% decline in sales reported by shark fin vendors in Guangzhou, China and a decrease in prices (47% retail and 57% wholesale) over the past two years… 85% of Chinese consumers surveyed online said they gave up shark fin soup within the past three years, and two-thirds of these respondents cited awareness campaigns as a reason for ending their shark fin consumption.”</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/world/asia/china-says-no-more-shark-fin-soup-at-state-banquets.html">government ban</a> on shark fin soup at state banquets, where the dish was seen as a major status symbol, was a major factor in its declining popularity, acknowledges Wild Aid’s Baker. “The fact that the government had an explicit position goes a long way in China.” But there were a number of keys to the campaign’s success of the campaign, he adds, most notably the willingness of the hugely popular and respected former basketball star Yao Ming to serve as its spokesman.</p>
<p>“We came at it from every angle – overfishing, depleting the oceans, the cruelty involved in finning, toxicology due to accumulated heavy metals. Most people in mainland China didn’t even realize what was in the soup, because the term for it in Mandarin doesn’t include the word shark,” explains Baker. “It helped that CCTV [China’s gigantic public television network] produced a segment for their 60 Minutes-like news program. And we had huge support from media partners, equivalent to about $200 million in donated media to air public service announcements, which we got for free. We don’t use overly graphic imagery, and we run campaigns that are generally positive rather than shaming wrong behavior.”</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/28838668" width="100%" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Wild Aid is now leading campaigns against the consumption of manta rays, elephant ivory and rhino horns, using the star power of Jackie Chan and David Beckham, among others. “Some people say China will never change, but our experience is that it’s actually changing quite fast, and in many ways for the better,” says Baker.</p>
<p>“The Wild Aid campaign looks like an excellent case study in how to use mass media and the power of celebrity effectively,” says Olson. “I give them the highest marks for effective communication in ocean conservation, with Sea Shepherd [which has generated considerable media attention by obstructing whalers on the high seas] a close second. Most NGOs are too literal minded to understand how it all works.”</p>
<p>Still, Baker acknowledges that campaigning to protect animals such as sharks and rays is probably easier than working on more abstract or diffuse issues, such as halting overfishing, ocean acidification, preventing trash and pollution from entering the ocean, or protecting coastal ecosystems: “The more specific it is and the more it relates to people’s lives, the easier it is to communicate.”</p>
<h2><strong>Peer Pressure</strong></h2>
<p>If communications campaigns are to grapple effectively with these broader issues, they will probably need to come up with new approaches, according to RARE’s Sadowsky and her colleague Kevin Green.</p>
<p>“The most disruptive technology in social change is the emergence of new fields in behavioral sciences, looking at how people make decisions and cooperate,” explains Green. “Traditionally, social marketing focused on how behavior related to the costs and benefits for individuals. Social change industries were built on the assumption that people are rational maximizers – <em>homo economicus</em>.</p>
<p>“But the new field of behavioral economics, and new ideas from social psychology, political science and evolutionary theory are converging on how humans cooperate. That is altering how we approach behavior change. People can act collectively if they’re motivated to do so, and there are no greater collective action problems than oceans and climate change.</p>
<p>“An example of the new approach would be messaging that works to strengthen group identities. For instance, if you have a community that is comprised of many different fishers, you would try to get them all to adopt sustainable management practices. They might not have a sense of their group identity, or that identity might just be latent or not strong,” says Green. “So, first you need to strengthen group identity by using messaging that promotes existing values that enable them shift norms collectively.”</p>
<p>“Previously, we just reached out to individuals as to why they should change their behavior,” adds Sadowsky. “Now we’re trying to establish normative behavior. A lot of research has shown &#8212; even in the US but especially in developing countries &#8212; that the sense of what other people are doing is hugely motivating to get people to try things they haven’t done before, and getting them to stick to it. It’s the different between using a ‘we’ term as opposed to a ‘you’ term.”</p>
<p>Green and Sadowsky point to successful strategies such as the <a href="https://opower.com/solutions/energy-efficiency">Opower Energy Efficiency</a> approach, where energy consumption in a neighborhood is made publicly observable. When people see how their neighbors are reducing their energy consumption, they are motivated to do likewise. Another example is the messaging you often see in hotel rooms, urging patrons to re-use their towels to save on the electricity (and the cost) used in washing them. It turns out, explains Sadowsky, that standard environmental messaging works less well in such cases than messages which state, for instance, that a majority of the previous residents in that hotel, or even in that room, re-used their towels.</p>
<p>The research findings have essentially re-emphasized that humans are social creatures, and that social marketing programs – especially when aimed at resolving collective action problems &#8212; have to focus on “moving the herd” as opposed to a bunch on individuals. “We call them Pride campaigns, because pride in a community or their environment is one of the most powerful motivating forces, even when trying to put food on the table,” explains Green.</p>
<p>And if that pride is not there, or if a norm doesn’t exist in a community, social marketers look to connect groups, especially as the issues they’re tackling get bigger and even global in nature. That’s where media can be helpful. Green cites the Ice Bucket Challenge that spread like wildfire (ostensibly to raise money for ALS research) as an example of the power of social media in particular, but he and his colleagues are looking to change norms as opposed to a one-off action.</p>
<p>“When a norm doesn’t exist in one place but does elsewhere, we have to tap into that normative behavior even if it’s not within eyesight,” he concludes.</p>
<h2><strong>Marine Neuromarketing</strong></h2>
<p>Nichols, meanwhile, has been studying a different approach, looking at what neuroscience research has to say about individual human behavior. But his conclusions seem to fit in well with those of the social marketers.</p>
<p>“Neuroscience will change the way we do laws and education, so it will also be useful in understanding why water is appealing,” says Nichols, the author of a book – <em>Blue Mind </em>– whose tag line essentially comprises its thesis:<em> The Surprising Science That Shows How Being Near, In, On or Under Water Can Make You Happier, Healthier, More Connected and Better at What You Do. </em> “There’s lots of interesting research going on, although it’s not necessarily right on the dot in terms of ocean conservation.”</p>
<p>Nichols and his colleagues <a href="http://blogs.edf.org/edfish/2012/01/03/neuroconservation-your-brain-on-ocean/">brought together</a> some leading neuroscientists with some of the best people working with water to use electroencephalograms and fMRI equipment to see “<a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/07/19/why_our_brains_love_the_ocean_science_explains_what_draws_humans_to_the_sea/">why our brains love the ocean</a>.”</p>
<p>“The ocean gives us oxygen, jobs and seafood, but it also gives us romance, creativity, solitude, spirituality, privacy, relaxation, and a feeling of awe. Fishermen love the feeling of being out on the water, although they may not talk about it in public, and it’s the same with scientists who work on the ocean.</p>

<p>“The number one source of awe for people is nature, and within nature it is bodies of water, according to a <a href="http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_awe_makes_us_generous">study</a> by UC Irvine and UC Berkeley. This feeling of awe gives us higher feelings of empathy and compassion, and shifts our perception of time, shifts us from a ‘me’ perspective to a ‘we’ perspective.</p>
<p>“This has implications for conservation. Once we understand it better, it could change the way we talk about the oceans. Currently, we don’t see words like ‘awe’ and ‘romance’ and ‘creativity’ in such communications, instead the focus is on economic value. But whenever we put a number on the blue economy it massively undervalues the worth of the oceans.”</p>
<p>Nichols is aware that his exploration of these themes has opened him to criticism. “People ask me why I’m wrecking my career as an ecologist,” he admits. “But hanging out with neuroscientists &#8212; it’s the hardest science in the room, it’s not ‘touchy-feely’. Neuromarketers put these lessons into practice. Corona uses Blue Mind to sell bad beer. McDonalds and Coke sell love and happiness. We in the conservation community shy away from those words.”</p>
<p>There is indeed criticism of this approach. Olson agrees that “Ocean Lovers” is a real phenomenon — people become so infatuated with the oceans they can’t get enough of just loving them. But when it comes to communications, he complains, it’s also the recipe for boredom.</p>
<p>RARE’s Sardowsky points out that if the audience is first world donors, the emotional hook is extremely important to get them to sign a petition or give money to a cause. But for audiences such as those in the developing world who are concerned about survival every day, even if emotion plays a big role, there has to be a material benefit for collective action.</p>
<p>Then there are the “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/09/mindless">new neuro-skeptics</a>” who question what the approach of using neuroscience to determine how we make decisions has gotten us thus far. “A core objection is that neuroscientific ‘explanations’ of behavior often simply re-state what’s already obvious,” writes Adam Gopnik in <em>The New Yorker</em>. “Neuroscience can often answer the obvious questions but rarely the interesting ones.”</p>
<p>One of the more interesting questions that neuroscience should seemingly be able to help answer is how do we make decisions. In fact, the study of “decision science” now goes back decades and has been often <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by9Ih-ZlIzk">cultivated toward environmental ends</a>.</p>
<p>“What’s missing is that there’s a vast subconscious we’re not aware of, but that is where the action is,” claims Nichols. “It’s not necessarily that ‘you’re deciding’, but it’s more about behavior science. We can look at what a brain does when someone is answering questions, and often it will indicate something very different from what they’re saying. The truth is we don’t really know why people decide – calling it ‘motivation science’ might be a better term, or the science of drive.</p>
<p>Nichols is a fan of the book <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes'_Error">Descartes’ Error</a></em> by the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, which claims that humans are driven more by irrational tendencies than we’re willing to admit. After reading it, Nichols came to accept that actions are often driven by emotions, not a rational analysis of information.</p>
<p>Neuromarketers are trying to turn the art of persuasion into something <a href="http://www.iftf.org/uploads/media/SR-1321_IFTF_FutureofPersuasionReport-1.pdf">approaching a science,</a> but they haven’t thought much about the oceans yet. Still, says Nichols, their work could have implications for the way we communicate about the ocean. It could help us better time our delivery of conservation messages, for instance, by displaying them when people disembark from whale-watching boats or come ashore after kayaking.</p>
<p>“I understand there are reasons why big NGOs and funding agencies tend to go too narrow too quickly in their messaging. It’s easier to justify to lots of people, but it’s wrong,” he asserts. “There’s a disconnect between the Neuroscience departments and the Ecology departments on campus, even though they may only be a couple of minutes away from each other.”</p>
<p>Green from RARE concludes that, “we often rationalize after the fact, but by and large we are not rational decision-makers. Decisions are often made at least as much on an emotional basis. It’s not a purely selfish maximizing calculation, but sometimes we’re afraid to admit that.”</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>What can we conclude from all this speculation about the future of ocean communications?</p>
<p>There will always be a need to communicate the rational basis for protecting the oceans, to explain what the data is telling us about their status, and to offer up practical science-based solutions. That has always been vital, but it appears not to be sufficient.</p>

<p>Increasingly, communications experts are telling us that as much as we may worry about the state of the oceans, spreading fears and lectures about impending doom should take a back seat to the use of peer pressure and the adoption of entertainment techniques in efforts to change public policy and behavior. This is particularly true if the goal is not just sustainability, but preservation.</p>
<p>Scaring people can spur action, but inspiring them may be more sustainable in the long run. After all, there has always been a mythical, or mystical, component to conservation. We don’t just protect forests or landscapes because we need them, but also because of the way they make us feel to be in them, or just to look at them.</p>
<p>Maybe what all the technology and the neuroscience and the social marketing research is telling us is that, to value and protect the oceans, we first need to remind people how much they love them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A large number of marine animals end up as bycatch. Could smarter nets make a difference?</strong></p>
<p>Daniel Stepputtis&#8217; face fell as his crew lifted their trawl net out of the grey waters of the Baltic and over the side of the boat. Like a yeti emerging from the sea, thick red algae clogged every hole in the specially-designed net&#8217;s mesh.</p>
<p>On this cloudy day in the middle of July, the algae – or &#8216;Kraut&#8217; as the fishermen call it – was blooming.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s it for today,&#8221; Stepputtis, a fisheries biologist, declared as his colleagues began the tedious task of cleaning the tangled mess.</p>

<p>Wearing orange plastic overalls and helmets to protect against cold water and heavy onboard machinery, researchers aboard the <em>Clupea</em> emptied their small catch into a large container. Muddy cod and flatfish of all sizes came tumbling out of the net, but the scientists from the Thünen Institute of Baltic Sea Fisheries couldn&#8217;t hide their disappointment. They would have no choice but to repeat their work in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Stepputtis&#8217; research team has been testing the effectiveness of FLEX nets, a new fishing net prototype that aims to reduce bycatch, or animals that are unintentionally caught by fishermen. Conducting research on the open water where weather and currents are always in flux, however, is challenging and often unpredictable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Baltic Sea cod fishing season takes place mainly during the winter, when algae is less likely to bloom and researchers can focus on other problems clogging fishing nets. Flukes, plaices and other species of flatfish that live on the ground also get pulled in by fishermen. After the trawls are emptied, the fisherman throw these species back into the sea, a procedure many don’t survive.</p>

<p>In his narrow office crammed with paperwork and books, Daniel Stepputtis is working on solutions to this problem. A tall blonde scientist sporting a goatee, Stepputtis is in charge of the working group for survey and fishing technology at the Thünen Institute of Baltic Sea Fisheries – a sleek modern structure located right at the old harbor of Rostock, Germany.</p>
<p>His team is working to address one simple question: &#8220;If you don’t want to catch [the fish], how can you get them out [of the net]?&#8221; Unfortunately, the answers are complex and different for each fishery.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not only in the Baltic that different species end up in the trawls, but all around the world,&#8221; Stepputtis explains. This bycatch poses a problem not only to environmentalists, but also to fishermen who have to drag additional, unprofitable weight through the water and meticulously sort through the catch, which costs them time, energy, and money. And they know that a lot of what they throw back later dies.</p>

<p>In response to this problem, Swedish fisherman Vilnis Ulups began to experiment with the idea of building &#8220;emergency exits&#8221; into the nets to accommodate different body morphologies of flatfish and round codfish. If one could build holes thin enough for flatfish to swim through, he thought, then their bycatch could be reduced without affecting the cod harvest.</p>
<p>Ulups got in touch with the experts at Thünen who liked the idea and started to refine the prototype he had built. The net featured metal bars that formed slim exits for the flatfish, however, when researchers ventured out to sea to conduct tests, it did not work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fish seemed to feel uneasy, and stayed away from [the exit holes],&#8221; recalls Stepputtis. The flatfish inexplicably remained at the bottom of the nets, far from any chance at escape. To find out why, the researchers installed cameras to monitor what was happening. &#8220;We tried to put ourselves in [their] place,&#8221; Stepputtis explains.</p>

<p>So, how could the scientists help the flatfish find their emergency exits?</p>
<p>The answer turned out to be quite simple. Just like traffic islands divert streams of cars and bikes, a similar structure could direct the flatfish toward the holes in the nets. Using the underwater cameras to monitor the adapted net, Stepputtis and his team saw fish turning to avoid the obstacle, which led them toward the holes and ultimately, freedom. The concept was viable.</p>
<p>Tests have shown that this early prototype, known as the FRESWIND – short for Flatfish Rigid Escape Windows – was able to significantly reduce flatfish bycatch by up to 60 percent. Less flatfish clogging the nets means that juvenile cod can also escape and reproduce, which helps to stabilize the population. The overall reductions in bycatch were so substantial that the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) named the FRESWIND net as one of the runners-up in their <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/smart-gear-winners-2014" target="_blank">Smart Gear Competition in 2014</a>.</p>

<p><i>Side by side comparison of the FRESWIND (left) and FLEX net prototypes</i></p>
<p>&#8220;[Bycatch] is a major issue in fisheries all around the globe,&#8221; explains Mike Osmond, who runs the WWF’s international contest. &#8220;The amount is astronomical.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it’s not only fish. Numerous other species from benthic invertebrates to turtles, whales, and sea birds are also affected by equipment deployed by the global fishing industry.</p>
<p>According to a WWF estimate, <a href="http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/bycatch_paper.pdf?_ga=1.134657715.311868031.1455131349" target="_blank">over 40 percent of the global catch is bycatch</a> – a truly staggering, but much disputed number. Christopher Zimmermann, who heads the Thünen Institute of Baltic Sea Fisheries, says that WWF deliberately widened its definition of bycatch to make the situation &#8220;as dramatic as possible.&#8221; While it remains a major problem that must be addressed to reduce human impact on the seas, he believes that only around 7 percent of the global fish catch can actually be considered bycatch.</p>
<p>The rest, Thünen researchers say, is &#8220;unwanted catch&#8221; – fish that can still be sold by fisherman at the port or brought home for dinner – but the authors of the WWF study criticize this as a definition that&#8217;s too narrow to grasp the problem. It&#8217;s not only a dispute over the right definition of bycatch that makes it hard to actually come up with numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The magnitude […] is really very hard to quantify,&#8221; says Kim Detloff, who heads the Marine Conservation section at the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU), a German environmental NGO. &#8220;In the past,&#8221; he says, &#8220;you could only estimate how much unwanted fish went overboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>But no matter what proportion of global catch, bycatch remains a major environmental problem that kills a massive amount of sea life each year. It’s an issue that scientists and fishermen alike are looking to tackle.</p>
<p>Decades ago, nobody worried about catching a little extra in the net. The oceans were a vast, endless supply of fish and other seafood. &#8220;For a long time, the meshes were so small, everything was caught,&#8221; remembers Gerd Junge, a 64-year-old fisherman who has worked in the industry for half a century. He recalls going out with huge trawlers that brought in everything from juveniles to adults. Within just ten years, the boats had taken out the entire codfish population off the coast of Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then in the late 60s, early 70s, minimum mesh openings were introduced to let the small fish escape,&#8221; recalls Junge – a first step towards more sustainable fishing practices. At that point, however, the changes were only made to allow juvenile codfish to evade capture and reproduce. The nets weren’t smart enough yet to distinguish between species.</p>
<p>As a child, Junge had watched the fishermen knit and repair their nets on the beach, fascinated by their craft. He studied fishing technology and started to work at Kloska GmbH in Rostock, a company that produces nets for fishing boats all over the world. He is now their head of production.</p>
<p>Within the quiet, spacious production hall, young men in blue overalls knit and repair meters and meters of nets in swift rhythm. Here, the prototype for the Thünen Institute’s award-winning net for multi-species selection was produced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it’s the right approach to sort different fish species within the net,&#8221; says Junge, who admits that the FRESWIND net’s higher price tag presents obstacles to greater industry use. &#8220;The fishermen will start to use them only if there is a legal basis, if it’s the law,&#8221; he says, &#8220;before that, there won’t be a market.&#8221; Economic pressure and legal regulations drive what happens in the fishing industry. A new net is a huge investment, especially for those working on a local scale.</p>
<p>Some of the other smart gear promoted by the WWF’s Smart Gear Competition sound like something out of a science fiction movie. The 2009 runner-up, HOVERCRAN, proposed reducing bycatch and seafloor damage by using low-intensity electrical pulses to startle shrimp up into a hovering trawl. Other proposals have outlined plans to deter sharks with magnets, scare birds away with lasers, and use foul-smelling pellets to keep sharks off of longline hooks.</p>
<p>Despite the economic stresses of the industry, some fishermen are pushing for change by developing their own new innovative concepts. Mike Osmond, who runs the competition, estimates that &#8220;70 percent of the winning ideas have come from fishermen.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of them is Kazuhiro Yamazaki, the captain of a Japanese tuna vessel, who brought home the prize in 2011 with a simple idea. He proposed protecting seabirds who often chase bait thrown out with longlines by using a double-weight branchline to increase their sinking rate. The crucial point of the design was to make it safe enough for fishermen to use without injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things I realized about the competition is that technology doesn’t have to be complex,&#8221; says Osmond. But he also stresses the importance of economic factors in order to get the new gear on the market and into practice. &#8220;A lot of developing countries […] can’t afford to implement or utilize new technologies that come along,&#8221; he explains, &#8220;until the technology can be made really cost-effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the winning ideas from the Smart Gear Competition have moved beyond the pilot stage, and are now used more widely in practice. Such is the case for the <a href="http://seaqualizer.com/" target="_blank">SeaQualizer</a>, a small device attached to the end of the line to avoid barotrauma in recreational sports fishing. When fish are pulled up from the depths, their lung bladder can inflate, which prevents them from swimming back down when released. Initially developed for red snappers in the Gulf of Mexico, the recompression device is now used along the U.S. Pacific coast.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G5v9E-WvVhk?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;w=560&amp;h=315" height="315" width="100%"></iframe></p>
<p>The Smart Gear competition has also provided new technology to reduce the bycatch of larger animals, such as turtles and whales. In 2005, a team from Canada and the U.S. handed in a <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/new-solutions-that-reduce-the-accidental-death-of-marine-life-reeled-in-by-international-smart-gear-competition" target="_blank">concept</a> for altering the chemical properties of gillnets, so that cetaceans such as whales or dolphins could better detect and even break them.</p>
<p>Gillnets are very thin, long walls of fishing net that are hung along the water column over long stretches. When fish swim through the mesh, they can pass until their gills are through, but then get stuck. Cetaceans who get caught in them are unable to go back to the surface to breathe and often drown.</p>
<p>In the Baltic Sea, the majority of fishermen use gillnets. &#8220;It’s a little known fact that we have a whale species here as well, off the North Sea and Baltic coasts &#8211; the porpoise,&#8221; Kim Detloff of NABU points out. The porpoise is a small mammal, with a dark body, white belly, and very small back fluke. Of the two populations found in the Baltic Sea, one is critically endangered. With only about 450 individuals left, Detloff says gillnets are their number one cause of death.</p>
<p>To prevent cetaceans from getting caught in gillnets, experts have also proposed the use of pingers, which send out signals to deter the whales. But under certain circumstances, these pingers have shown to lead to higher rather than lower whale mortality rates. The PAL, short for porpoise alarm, is a new kind of pinger that imitates actual whale clicks and is favored by some as a better solution. But to Kim Detloff, this remains less than optimal as it drives the porpoises out of areas where they feed and reproduce.</p>
<p>The risk of bycatch in gillnets isn’t limited to whales, dolphins, or porpoises. Gillnets also pose a threat to seabirds, who get tangled in the net when diving for food. Since seabirds and whales rely on different senses – seabirds are more focused on sight, while whales on hearing – it is hard to find a solution to protect both groups of animals.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a long way to go until we have developed a gillnet that can prevent bycatch of whales as well as seabirds,&#8221; Kim Detloff says. A shift to other fishing methods might have better effects. Rather than equipping the gillnets with fancy technology to scare off animals, longlines or fish traps could be used. Traditional methods that have been long been phased out or forgotten could be rediscovered and adapted.</p>
<p>However, Detloff believes no single alternative will be able to replace gillnets completely. Policy will have to play a role, he says, to make sure that certain areas important to the whales and other protected animals are exempt from gillnet fishing.</p>

<p>Bycatch is a complex problem with no single solution. In every type of fishery and with every technology used, the problem looks different. There is no silver bullet, short of bringing the entire fishing industry to a halt – which would threaten the food security of an estimated <a href="http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/3_foodconsumption/en/index5.html" target="_blank">billion people</a> around the world. But understanding the behavior and communication of each animal threatened is crucial to developing solutions for each type of fishery.</p>
<p>For the Baltic Sea, new rules are finally starting to make a difference. Since the beginning of 2015, the European Union has begun to enforce a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/fishing_rules/discards/index_en.htm" target="_blank">new discard ban</a>, which demands fishermen be held accountable for everything caught in their nets, not just the catch they want to sell. Unwanted bycatch has to be counted against the quota that fishermen are allowed to fish for, effectively reducing their commercial catch.</p>
<p>Fishermen in the region have been vocal in their opposition to this new law, but Zimmermann of the Thünen Institute hopes that this could incentivize fishermen to upgrade their gear.</p>
<p>In the future, new technologies to prevent bycatch could include digital imagery and livestreams directly from the net. Instead of fishing in the dark, cameras could enable fishermen to evaluate the species and size of fish in the net before hauling the catch aboard.</p>

<p>For now, the Thünen researchers are using cameras to optimize their smart nets and take small, but important steps to reduce the side effects of fishing on the marine ecosystem – in an ecologically as well as economically sustainable sense. &#8220;Only if both come together, we will have a fishing industry that can feed us in the long term – one that we can accept,&#8221; explains Stepputtis.</p>
<p>So as soon as the algae is gone, Stepputtis and his team will go back out to sea to test FLEX, their latest prototype – a trawl net with a wide-open window and a little ramp, letting flatfish elegantly slide down to freedom.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few palm trees stand strong in the salty breeze. Located on the southern tip of the Pacific island chain of Hawaii, Kamilo Beach is an isolated stretch of black volcanic shoreline in the middle of nowhere. Just a few hundred yards from shore, humpback whales rise up from the depths, colorful fish fill the reefs and rare sea turtles swim in to nest on the beach.</p>
<p>But even in this remote place, garbage washes ashore each day. “We find a lot of toothbrushes and combs, plastic bottles and caps, over and over again,” says Megan Lamson, a marine biologist working for a local non-governmental organization, the <a href="http://www.wildhawaii.org/" target="_blank">Hawai‘i Wildlife Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Old Hawaiian sayings have described the bay as a place where people went looking for loved ones if they got lost at sea. “Historically that area has been kind of the catcher of things that are floating in the ocean,” Lamson says. But over time, the composition of materials that wash ashore has changed dramatically. “Back in the day it was large pieces of heavy wood from other continents,” she says, “now, unfortunately, it’s a lot of plastic.”</p>

<p>It’s an all too familiar sight around the world. Since the early 1970s, researchers have collected plastic from beaches and oceans around the globe. At the 9-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of coastline around South Point alone, about 15 to 20 tons (14 to 18 metric tons) of trash wash up each year. “Here on Hawaiian beaches, we have debris from all around the North Pacific,” Nikolai Maximenko, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, explains. Some pieces come from Asia, others from the West Coast of North America, and, Maximenko adds, “of course we have local products, too.”<i> </i></p>
<h2><b>From Gyre to Garbage Patch</b></h2>
<p>To understand how a remote place like Kamilo can get so swamped by massive amounts of trash, one must consider the hydrodynamics at play.</p>
<p>Hawaii is located in a huge circular system of ocean currents, the North Pacific Gyre. Within the gyre, trash can get trapped and circulate for years. One region between the islands and California contains such a high density of man-made debris that it has been nicknamed the Eastern Pacific Garbage Patch. When currents change, the garbage can wash back ashore — and so it is found on beaches like Kamilo.</p>
<p>At the International Pacific Research Center in Honolulu, Maximenko and his colleagues have taken major steps in understanding how marine debris travels the oceans’ currents. He and his team have developed a computer simulation that can project the behavior of floating items at sea. By using drifter buoys and satellite data, the model indicates <a href="https://vimeo.com/8350606" target="_blank">how trash accumulates in the oceans</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/8350606" width="100%" height="375" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Most debris <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gm2EjYbUXk" target="_blank">ends up in the five big subtropical ocean gyres</a> located in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans, which rotate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern. Water samples collected from these regions show elevated concentrations of plastic particles, and the evidence that the oceanic gyres are becoming marine debris hot spots continues to grow. According to new models by researchers from Australia, a sixth gyre might form in future decades — in the Arctic Barents Sea.</p>

<h2><b>Back From the Sea</b></h2>
<p>Each September, on <a href="http://www.oceanconservancy.org/our-work/international-coastal-cleanup/" target="_blank">International Coastal Cleanup d</a><a href="http://www.oceanconservancy.org/our-work/international-coastal-cleanup/">ay</a>, hundreds of thousands of volunteers across the globe roam the shores to collect trash. The effort not only removes litter, but also generates data that can provide a glimpse of what the oceans might contain.</p>
<p>In 2014, more than half a million participants collected over 16 million pounds (7,200 metric tons) of trash in just one day. The top five most commonly found items were cigarette butts, food wrappers, bottle caps, straws, stirrers and beverage bottles — common items of today’s modern consumer society. Collectors also found lawnmowers, light bulbs, wigs and even shopping carts.</p>
<p>Though many of these items are quickly discarded, they are made from a material that might last decades or even centuries.</p>
<p>The damage and suffering this causes for ocean life is severe. Plastics can be found in the stomachs of whales, fish and many other marine animals. Turtles suffocate when they confuse shopping bags with jellyfish, or drown when they get entangled in discarded nets. Seals get stuck in plastic rings from six-packs that slowly cut through their necks. In the middle of the Pacific, albatross chicks die, weakened from overconsumption of bottle caps and toys. The Convention on Biological Diversity <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/publications/cbd-ts-67-en.pdf" target="_blank">counts 663 species affected by ocean plastics</a>.</p>
<p>Another species that might be affected is the one that’s responsible. In 2015, researchers sampled fish and shellfish being sold for human consumption in Indonesian and Californian markets. They found plastic and textile fibers in <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14340" target="_blank">a quarter of the animals</a>.<b> </b></p>
<h2><b>A Grand Plan</b></h2>
<p>A solution is urgently needed. So why not just go and clean it up? There’s no lack of imagination when it comes to concepts to <a href="http://www.floatinghorizon.org/3rd-party-concepts.html" target="_blank">retrieve garbage from the sea</a>. Designers and engineers have proposed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VExyml-HGi0" target="_blank">marine drones</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBpSHoTXHrg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m22s" target="_blank">waterborne kites</a>, even <a href="http://www.evolo.us/competition/seawer-the-garbage-seascraper" target="_blank">huge artificial drains</a> for the gyres. A group of college students from London went so far as to promote the idea of <a href="http://2012.igem.org/Team:University_College_London" target="_blank">creating biotechnological microorganisms</a> to break up the plastics, and a Dutch architect wanted to <a href="https://vimeo.com/30893953" target="_blank">turn the trash into a “Recycled Island”</a> where people could settle sustainably. Despite the attention these concepts have gained, most of them have remained pretty 3-D renderings and — so far — unfulfilled ambitions.</p>
<p>Experts have tried to convey what a massive challenge it would be to clean up the ocean’s trash. The National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration has estimated <a href="http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/can-you-clean-pacific-garbage-patch" target="_blank">it would take 68 ships an entire year</a> to survey just 1 percent of the North Pacific. In another, more hypothetical calculation, ocean activist Charles Moore estimates that to clean all five garbage patches, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=SLyAg4qJvOQC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=moore%20plastic&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=79%20years&amp;f=false" target="_blank">1,000 boats would need to filter the water 24 hours a day for 79 years</a>, and that’s only if the technology existed.</p>
<p>But Boyan Slat, a young Dutch inventor, has tried to challenge the skeptics. Just out of school, he presented his ambitious idea to filter the open ocean in 2012: Instead of sending out boats to go after the trash, he argued, why not take advantage of the forces provided by the rotating currents of the gyres? If a filtering platform could be fixed to the seabed underneath the North Pacific garbage patch, one could get the trash out while the water flowed through it — and maybe even sell it for profit.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ROW9F-c0kIQ&amp;w=560&amp;h=315" height="315" width="100%"></iframe></p>
<p>Slat’s idea soon went viral and earned him a massive following, praise from around the world and millions of dollars in crowdfunding.</p>
<p>The project’s feasibility, however, has been under critical scrutiny. Kim Martini and Miriam Goldstein, both ocean scientists and bloggers, warn that Slat’s project could cause more harm than good by threatening delicate zooplankton and other animals living near the sea surface. The two also <a href="http://www.deepseanews.com/2014/07/the-ocean-cleanup-part-2-technical-review-of-the-feasibility-study/" target="_blank">point out how difficult it would be to fix the structure to the seabed</a>. They call Slat’s current plans “under engineered and likely to fail.”</p>
<p>To many environmentalists, Slat’s approach is flawed on a more fundamental level. They argue that by starting cleanup efforts when trash has already made it into the ocean <a href="http://inhabitat.com/the-fallacy-of-cleaning-the-gyres-of-plastic-with-a-floating-ocean-cleanup-array/" target="_blank">diverts attention from the real solutions</a>: reducing, reusing and recycling.</p>
<h2><b>Plastic Islands</b></h2>
<p>For many decades, environmental organizations have tried to raise awareness of how anthropogenic debris impacts marine life. But what finally sparked alarm among the public were reports of massive trash islands in the ocean, one reportedly “twice the size of Texas.” The only problem? The islands don’t really exist.</p>
<p>In fact, plastic is distributed quite widely over the vast oceans. The garbage patches are not solid islands, but regions where relatively high concentrations of small plastic pieces are dispersed in the upper part of the water column, hardly visible from above.</p>
<p>So how much is in there, really? Estimates on total plastic accumulation in the world’s oceans have ranged from the thousands to hundreds of millions of tons. While some figures that have been cited by media are pure speculation, others rely on data that are decades old. “In the open ocean, the abundance, distribution, and temporal and spatial variability of plastic debris is poorly known,” a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5996/1185.full" target="_blank">team of experts concluded</a> in 2010.</p>
<p>To produce more accurate estimates, scientists have carried out a number of studies in recent years, but figures still vary considerably. While it’s possible that researchers will never come up with a precise figure, plastic pollution will most likely grow in scale with rising production.</p>
<h2><b>The Rise of Plastics</b></h2>
<p>For a long time, the development of plastics was perceived as a big success story. And not without good reasons: Synthetic materials have advanced human civilization, wealth and comfort in uncountable ways.</p>
<p>In 1907, the Belgian-born chemist Leo Baekeland developed Bakelite, the first synthetic plastic polymer, branded “The Material of a Thousand Uses.” Bakelite was moldable, heat-resistant and nonconductive, so it was soon used for a multitude of products, from electrical insulators and casings for telephones and radios to toys, poker chips and firearms.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, new synthetic materials started surfacing on the market.</p>
<p>Global plastic production rose from <a href="http://www.plasticseurope.org/documents/document/20131014095824-final_plastics_the_facts_2013_published_october2013.pdf" target="_blank">1.7 million metric tons (1.9 million tons) in 1950 to close to 299 million metric tons (330 million tons) in 2013</a>. And the numbers continue to grow. Today, it is hard to think of products that don’t contain or aren’t wrapped in plastics. Plastics make transportation more carbon efficient, keep food fresh to avoid wasting it and allow us to see through contact lenses — to just name a few benefits.</p>
<p>But the negative effects on the environment have also been pervasive. A few decades of heavy use have spread plastics around the globe. Today, the remnants of our products can be found <a href="http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/4/140317" target="_blank">from the surface of oceans to deep-sea sediment</a>, in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/us/scientists-turn-their-gaze-toward-tiny-threats-to-great-lakes.html" target="_blank">lakes</a> and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749114000475" target="_blank">rivers</a>, even <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/05/trillions-plastic-pieces-may-be-trapped-arctic-ice" target="_blank">frozen in Arctic ice</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Catching the Trash</b></h2>
<p>While efforts to find a viable method to clean existing ocean plastic are laudable, they won’t stop more trash from entering the oceans, often through rivers and streams.</p>
<p>In Baltimore, an inventor had an idea to catch the trash before it could reach the high seas. John Kellett worked near the city’s heavily polluted harbor for many years — an “ugly piece of water” to most visitors, as he recalls.</p>
<p>Kellett realized that much of this plastic reaching the harbor came from the Jones Falls, a stream that accumulates trash as it winds through residential neighborhoods.</p>
<p>With local partners, Kellett began working to construct a device that would skim garbage from the surface of the river before it could float downstream: a solar- and wind-powered, trash-intercepting waterwheel.</p>
<p>No longer just an idea in Kellett’s head, the <a href="http://baltimorewaterfront.com/healthy-harbor/water-wheel/" target="_blank">Inner Harbor Water Wheel</a> was deployed in 2014 and has become a prominent city landmark. Resembling a giant nautilus, it has orange booms that cover the 35-meter-wide (40-yard-wide) mouth of the Jones Falls and directs items floating on the surface to a conveyor belt, where they are collected before they can reach the harbor. The trash is then emptied into a large container under the waterwheel’s white roof and hauled off.</p>

<p>Kellett estimates that around three-quarters of the trash that would have floated into the inner Baltimore harbor is now being caught instead.</p>
<p>“Its footprint is tiny, its reach is huge,” deep-sea biologist <a href="http://www.southernfriedscience.com/?p=17362" target="_blank">Andrew David Thaler wrote</a> about the waterwheel, and he is not the only marine scientist who has praised Kellett’s attempts to clean up closer to the source.</p>
<p>So will waterwheels be a familiar sight at most river mouths one day? Kellett hopes this won’t have to be the case. “We find that a small river is a challenging place to try to clean the trash out of,” he admits. Although the inventor has received a number of requests to deploy his technology in other places around the world, and he sees good potential to scale it up for midsize rivers and harbors, his ultimate goal is to put the waterwheel out of work. As he points out, if there were better education, legislation and technology, the trash might not show up in the rivers and travel to the ocean in the first place.</p>

<h2><b>New Challenge: Microplastics</b></h2>
<p>At the Wuppertal wastewater treatment plant in Germany, foggy clouds hang low on the green hills around large pools. In a noisy hall, big metal rakes work hard to hold back the solid trash that the wastewater carries with it, from wet wipes, condoms and toilet paper to wood and the occasional stone.</p>
<p>Outside, the water flows into large filtering pools, measuring 20 to 30 meters (70 to 100 feet) in diameter. There, everything heavier than water is separated mechanically. Only some Q-tips are light enough to escape. The water is then directed into bubbling pools, where bacteria digest all they can.</p>
<p>“Our microorganisms have a life span of around 10 days,” explains Volker Erbe, technical division manager of Wupperverband, the entity that takes care of water management around the river Wupper and runs the Wuppertal wastewater treatment plant. Plastics, however, are not on their menu, he says. Which is unfortunate, because there is a new challenge wastewater treatment plants have to deal with — and it’s almost invisible.</p>
<div id="attachment_746" style="width: 3072px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/21282786668_79dbd26f13_o.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-746" class="size-full wp-image-746" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/21282786668_79dbd26f13_o.jpg" alt="Microplastics (Courtesy: Oregon State University)" width="3062" height="2012" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/21282786668_79dbd26f13_o.jpg 3062w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/21282786668_79dbd26f13_o-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/21282786668_79dbd26f13_o-1024x673.jpg 1024w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/21282786668_79dbd26f13_o-1020x670.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 3062px) 100vw, 3062px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-746" class="wp-caption-text">Plastic particles (Courtesy: Oregon State University)</p></div>
<p>Micro- and nanoplastics are the new category of plastic litter that even facilities in the most developed countries are not yet equipped for. And so, though the water may look clean, it really isn’t.</p>
<p>The source can be inspected in many bathrooms around the world. From toothpastes and deodorants to shower gels, eye shadow and sunscreen, numerous beauty products contain tiny plastic particles, a <a href="http://unep.org/gpa/documents/publications/PlasticinCosmetics2015Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank">2015 U.N. Environment Programme</a> report reveals. They deliver active ingredients, exfoliate, regulate viscosity and fulfill numerous other functions. And this is not new: Producers of cosmetics and cleaning agents have been adding plastics to their formulas for decades.</p>
<p>Some products are made up of 90 percent of these tiny plastic grains. They are so small their size is described in micrometers, which are a thousandth of a millimeter. For comparison: A human hair is around 100 micrometers thick. Some producers even go tinier and add nanoplastics, which are in the range of millionths of millimeters. To also put this into perspective: Human DNA is 2.5 nanometers in diameter.</p>
<p>How many of these particles reach rivers and streams, and eventually the ocean, is still unclear.</p>
<p>At the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in northern Germany, a research team under senior scientist Gunnar Gerdts has conducted a <a href="https://www.awi.de/nc/en/about-us/service/press/press-release/pilot-study-reveals-new-findings-about-microplastics-in-wastewater.html" target="_blank">pilot study</a> to find out how much plastic escapes wastewater treatment plants. “I expected that we wouldn’t find very much, because nanomaterials are said to be held back pretty well by the sewage sludge,” explains Gerdts, “but what we actually found was that wastewater treatment plants do emit microplastics into the rivers in substantial ways.” He notes that the amounts his team found in samples from different facilities varied greatly, so more research is needed to understand the scope of the issue.</p>
<p>The impacts of the tiny particles and fibers on marine animals are still under investigation. For some species, such as mussels, lab experiments have shown <a href="https://www.awi.de/nc/en/about-us/service/press/press-release/microplastics-in-the-ocean-biologists-study-effects-on-marine-animals.html" target="_blank">adverse health effects</a> such as inflammation. And there are other risks: Plastics can contain problematic additives such as bisphenol A, and microbeads show a tendency to <a href="http://www.pelletwatch.org/" target="_blank">attract persistent organic pollutants such as DDT</a> from the water around them. That could result in quite a cocktail accumulating in animals up the food chain.</p>

<p>Micro- and nanoplastics are particles and not uniformly distributed, so measuring their concentration is a difficult process, unlike pharmaceuticals, which dissolve in water and are therefore present in every probe. To not only detect micro- and nanoplastics, but hold them back completely in a wastewater treatment plant, requires a whole additional stage of cleaning, which comes at a cost that is ultimately passed down to consumers.</p>
<p>“The moment of truth is out there when wastewater treatment plants decide that it’s a priority for them not to let go of microplastics,” says Lars Grønbæk, a process engineer working for the Danish wastewater purification company KD. Grønbæk is a specialist in membranes that can remove tiny particles from water using a principle similar to a coffee filter.</p>
<p>It’s “not new rocket technology,” Grønbæk says. His company’s flatsheet membranes are already capable of filtering down to a size of a tenth of a micron, he says, and they could be further refined. But at the moment, only a small fraction of wastewater treatment plants are deploying membrane filters, says Grønbæk. As long as there is no regulation requiring them to do so, this is unlikely to change.</p>
<p>Volker Erbe of Wupperverband believes there is a better way to tackle the issue: “We need to think about not using materials that can become a problem for the environment, instead of trying to remove them with expensive technologies from our wastewater.”</p>
<p>It seems that the first steps in this direction are being taken. In late 2015, President Obama signed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1321" target="_blank">the Microbead-Free Waters Act</a>, which bans tiny plastics in cosmetics and other products.</p>
<h2><b>Fibers From Washers</b></h2>
<p>Another, equally unexpected source of microplastic pollution seems further away from a solution: the plastic footprint of washing machines. Much of the clothing produced today is made out of synthetic materials. Each time these clothes are washed, thousands of tiny plastic fibers can leak from the machine into the wastewater.</p>
<p>Dick Vethaak, professor of ecotoxicology at the VU University of Amsterdam, observed that more than <a href="https://www.deltares.nl/en/news/extra-filter-washing-machines-welcomed/" target="_blank">200,000 of those fibers can escape</a> in just one wash cycle. This is many times more than what previous studies had reported.</p>

<p>While most people won’t ever get to see the tiny fibers washing down their drains, a chance encounter had Blair Jollimore quickly looking for a solution. A mechanical engineer by day, Jollimore lives far from city drainage systems in a remote part of eastern Canada’s Nova Scotia. His house requires its own septic system.</p>
<p>One day after moving into his new home, Jollimore recalls, the basement flooded with wastewater. The family soon found out what the problem was, says Jollimore: “a gray mat inside the septic tank” that had blocked the pipe.</p>
<p>He quickly realized that most of what had clogged the system was lint from the water flowing out of his washing machine. So he used a water filter housing and a stainless steel strainer to construct a filtering device that he inserted between the washer and the drain. The septic tank didn’t overflow again.</p>
<p>What was initially just a solution to Jollimore’s own problem turned into a small business on the side, and Jollimore now sells around 50 of his <a href="http://environmentalenhancements.com/index.html" target="_blank">Lint LUV-R filters</a> per month. Together with researchers working on marine debris, he is looking into options for a wider market application of his washing machine lint filter.</p>
<p>If such a filter came standard on washing machines, it would be a quick win for the environment. But experts say designing one that is both cost effective and convenient to build into commercial washing machines will be a huge technological challenge. Producing these filters would be expensive and they could easily clog, making it impractical for consumer use.</p>
<p>And there seems to be little incentive, because neither consumers nor legislators have called to further develop and standardize the technology.</p>
<p>Even if it did become standard, it would only solve a part of the problem. “The same fibers, they also enter the water by air pollution,” Vethaak points out. “The real problem is that the textiles are not environmentally friendly.”</p>
<h2><b>Everything Falls Apart</b></h2>
<p>The biggest source of microplastics, however, is larger items breaking down. Every piece of plastic that makes it to the oceans falls apart with time. Ultraviolet light and the force of the waves degrade fishnets, plastic bags, bottles, caps and toothbrushes into smaller and smaller pieces.</p>
<p>These resulting particles are likely to be the major source of microplastics found in the environment, dwarfing the amount coming from cosmetic products or textiles, a <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/publikationen/sources-of-microplastics-relevant-to-marine" target="_blank">recent study</a> by the Federal Environment Agency of Germany suggests.</p>
<p>Tackling the influx of bigger items into the ocean will therefore be key to eventually reducing microplastic pollution.</p>
<p>Some emerging economies are growing so fast that their waste management systems can’t keep up, and so their contribution to marine debris is enormous. If just five countries — China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines — improved their recycling and waste disposal systems, they could “cut global inputs by almost half,” conclude the authors of <a href="http://www.oceanconservancy.org/our-work/marine-debris/mckinsey-report-files/full-report-stemming-the.pdf" target="_blank">a recent study by the Ocean Conservancy</a>.</p>
<p>Though this won’t stop plastic pollution entirely, it could buy us “time to rethink packaging more broadly and reduce the flow of plastic altogether,” <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/19/cut-plastic-waste-oceans-south-east-asia-fish-birds" target="_blank">the authors explain</a> in <i>The</i> <i>Guardian</i><i>. </i></p>
<p>Europe and North America may be better equipped to deal with their waste, but they also consume <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/global-plastic-production-rises-recycling-lags-0" target="_blank">five times as much plastic per person annually as people in Asia</a>, according to the Worldwatch Institute. And many of these richer countries export a large portion of their plastic waste, much of it ending up in China. With a global market that ships not only products, but also waste, the plastic problem is a truly global one.</p>
<p>Considering the vast scale of the world’s oceans, and the many pathways through which trash can make it there, it is unlikely that we will be able to find one technology to solve this complex and difficult problem. Many solutions will need to be conceived of and deployed at various levels in order to tackle plastic pollution from all possible angles. But the closer we can move from the gyres to the source, the better off our future oceans will be.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before Noavy started monitoring shark catches, she would only get up before dawn to harvest the seaweed that lies drying in various stages of rubbery or crispy tangles outside her home.</p>
<p>Nowadays, her data-collection on sharks being brought into her village means she&#8217;s up and on call at all hours, despite the fact that the animals have been rapidly disappearing from Madagascar&#8217;s shoreline for the past 30 years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before, there were big things in the sea. But now, it&#8217;s only sometimes,&#8221; she said from her hut in the village of Lamboara, home to a few hundred people on Madagascar&#8217;s south-west coast and marooned by afternoon lagoon tides.</p>
<p>Noavy is 46, but like many people in rural Madagascar, she doesn&#8217;t have a surname. She remembers being told not to go in the water as a teenager as the shallows were brimming with sharks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t go to wash ourselves because we were scared of them,&#8221; she recalls.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could see them from the beach,&#8221; and hear the stories of fishermen in <em>pirogues</em> &#8211; dug out canoes &#8211; mauled by sharks as they tried to reel in their catch, she adds.</p>
<p>But the fishermen up and down this overfished coast now have to paddle and sail for hours to find smaller sharks in the deeper waters, as the shores have been emptied.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/155511086" width="100%" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
It takes two hours of bumping down rocky tracks in a trolley-sized cart drawn by <em>zebu</em> &#8211; Madagascar&#8217;s beloved bulls &#8211; to reach Lamboara, and a few hours to sail the 15 kilometers back to reach a bigger village called Andavadoaka.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s there that British charity Blue Ventures has been working with local communities for a decade to set up Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs) with around 25 villages that have seen great success with octopus reserves that boost their numbers, and therefore people&#8217;s profits.</p>
<p>Now, the marine conservation organization is working with community members trained on how to record octopus and shark catches using mobile phones and tablets to better understand how local ecosystems work, and can be fished sustainably.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who live by the sea just think that the fish that have been there for centuries will just always be there, even though they&#8217;re decreasing&#8221;, says Roger Samba, president of the LMMA.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s vital that they have the tools to understand why fish stocks are falling, and how to control them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite invasive for a whole load of scientists to go into a village, and it&#8217;s a bit meaningless, whereas if you get a community to monitor resources and habit they&#8217;re fishing on it&#8217;s more meaningful for Blue Ventures but ultimately them&#8221;, says Tori Jeffers, who manages Blue Ventures&#8217; smartphone project. On a more local and immediate level, she hopes that data &#8220;fed back to community in an understandable manner&#8221; will help fuel decisions on shark fishing closures during pupping seasons or around breeding areas. The aim is not only to find out what and how much is being caught, by who and where, but to get faster, more accurate data that can be shared and analyzed on open data platforms.</p>
<p>An estimated 100 million sharks are caught globally per year and a quarter of shark and ray species are threatened with extinction.</p>
<p>But conservationists think that up to 40 percent might be endangered as so little is known about the sea&#8217;s vital predators that police the oceans&#8217; reefs.</p>
<p>Shark export records in Madagascar date back to the 1920s, but nowadays, despite agreements with foreign fleets allowed to fish for shark or have them in bycatch, there is very little monitoring along the 6,500 kilometer-long coastline.</p>
<p>And with severely-underfunded government patrols unable to purchase even the petrol for their boats, conservation has to start in the communities whose livelihoods depend on the oceans and see the future value of recording data.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like the phone as I can save everything; nothing gets lost,&#8221; says Noavy, who before might lose the data on a pen and pad or forget which fisherman had caught what.</p>
<p>It took a while for anyone to call Noavy to tell her that they&#8217;d caught a shark, as they were suspicious about their details being noted down or put into a smartphone.</p>
<p>Through Blue Ventures, she is able to pay them 300 ariary ($0.10) per shark as compensation for waiting while she does her work, &#8220;so now they see the benefit,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>She starts by measuring the length of the shark, photographing its body, head and mouth to make sure that fishermen don&#8217;t try to claim the same shark twice. She then determines and records its sex and entering the details of where and when it was caught.</p>
<p>In the three years she&#8217;s been recording details &#8211; first on paper, now a smartphone that she charges using a solar panel on her thatched roof &#8211; she&#8217;s noticed the general trend of sharks getting smaller and fewer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to find so many types of sharks, and now not many,&#8221; she says. Some species like the white shark, tiger shark and fresh water sharks have completely vanished from Lamboara&#8217;s nets.</p>
<p>In addition to the monitoring of sharks, fishermen have also started seeing the benefit of having information on what they catch for octopus, which have a short life and breeding span.</p>

<p>At the start, there was strong opposition to the idea of octopus closures. Many people with little faith in politicians and foreigners thought it was a trick to plunder their catch, rather than an effort to allow octopus stocks to rise. It was only later when the catches were shown to have improved that people embraced the idea and expanded it to over 20 neighboring villages.</p>
<p>&#8220;This kind of model that you apply and then have the opinion of the community is very important,” says Tinah Voahangy Martin, Blue Ventures&#8217; Fisheries Programme Assistant. “Conservation alone won&#8217;t change anything, because if people are told just to protect these resources, what are they going to do for their own living?&#8221;</p>
<p>60-year-old shark hunter Jean-Francois says that sharks were so big in the 1980s that fishermen would sometimes have to fill their <em>pirogues</em> with water &#8211; almost sinking them &#8211; so that they could get them on board to bring home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to catch so many sharks, but now it&#8217;s so difficult,&#8221; he says, before showing the jawbone of a shark that he proudly caught last month that produced 80 kilos of meat.</p>

<p>Just twenty or thirty years ago, the whole village would celebrate when a shark was brought in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone who wanted to eat would come and take some. But now, no one shares their sharks, as before life was much easier and slower and no one was here to buy this cheap meat. Now everyone wants it,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Asia&#8217;s 1980s economic boom sparked a global shark market that peaked in the mid-1990s, with shark fin soup seen as a luxury item.</p>
<p>The fin market is now worth up to $500 million per year, and while increasing awareness of the shark-finning process is turning many people off, the taste for shark meat is increasing, as is the use of shark liver oil for biomedical purposes.</p>
<p>Industrial shark fishing in Madagascar&#8217;s Economic Export Zone (EEZ) really took off in the 1990s. Some European and Asian boats have public agreements with the Malagasy government and some have private agreements. It&#8217;s hard to tell which boats are above board, and whether or not they&#8217;re sticking to their quotas.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many boats that come at night and by morning they&#8217;re gone. We just see the lights. There&#8217;s a lot of illegal fishing,&#8221; says Samba.</p>

<p>Local fishers complain about industrial fishing boats encroaching on their business with bigger and better equipment that allows them to sweep up many big fish further out.</p>
<p>&#8220;So many sharks want to come here, but they catch them,&#8221; says Jean-Francois.</p>
<p>&#8220;I often see the big boats, and if I don&#8217;t see them, every day I hear them,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>But overfishing by locals means that the shorelines are no longer a refuge for sharks. It took Blue Ventures some time to explain that sharks played an important role as “policemen of the sea” controlling other species and ecosystems before people understood their worth in the water.</p>
<p>On the tiny and barren island of Andragnambala, there are no schools or clinics, just a cluster of huts housing around 160 people – all of whom depend solely on fishing to survive.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t earn from fish here, you&#8217;d suffer miserably,&#8221; says shark monitor Lydia Lamy, whose husband has just pulled in a shark that turns out to be pregnant with six well-formed pups. The catch will net him the equivalent of $2.50.</p>
<p>Only a handful of people here have been to school, but the community knows that killing pregnant sharks is a bad idea.</p>
<p>And the men here know that the more fibrous a shark fin, the more they will get paid from collectors that make the 12 kilometer trip from the mainland.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine what they want with the fins, but I know that they want the fibers,&#8221; says Aim<span class="_Tgc">é</span>, a fisherman who has just pulled in a hammerhead shark &#8211; an endangered species &#8211; for the price of around 25,000 ariary, or $5.</p>
<p>Blue Ventures is slowly teaching people about the role of sharks in keeping other fish stocks healthy. They hope that the open data kit form might be used across Madagascar and beyond to shine a light on what&#8217;s happening in the blue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lydia and Noavy are among 13 data collectors in eight villages that are trying to spread an important conservationist message: only by knowing what you have in the sea, can you protect it for future generations.</p>
<p>Like many along Lamboara&#8217;s coast, they would prefer to return to days when they were scared to let their children bathe in shallow waters full of pupping sharks, rather that live in a world without them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to protect sharks for our children’s future,” says 60-year-old fisherman Jean-Francois. “If we just keep catching them there will be nothing left.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), launched amidst huge fanfare at the UN General Assembly in New York from 25 -27 September 2015, are being heralded as transformational, universal, and indivisible. The groundswell of political will mobilized around the SDGs could help break the deadlocks over climate change and trade disputes that have been stifling progress towards sustainable development for years. But to actually make this happen, these 17 goals will need to trigger a major – and long overdue – disruption of the global status quo, fundamentally shift priorities, and redress entrenched injustices.</p>
<p>The Global Ocean Commission has been actively supporting the efforts of the Pacific Small Islands Developing States and other countries to develop and promote one of the 17 SDGs, which covers more than 70 percent of the planet: the Ocean SDG, also known as SDG 14. In it, States pledge to “conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development,&#8221; which is in many respects the exact opposite of how we use the ocean today. Instead of extracting fish and other resources for short-term profit – often in complete disregard of scientific warnings about the consequences – achieving this goal will require decisions to be taken on the basis of what is fair and responsible, on need rather than greed. SDG 14 should result in management decisions being taken according to how much they benefit the most vulnerable island and coastal communities and the rest of humankind (even if you live far from the ocean, every second breath of air you take comes from it); a profound shift compared to today. Instead of leaving the high seas, the vast 64% of the ocean beyond any national jurisdiction, as a virtual free-for-all (or, at least, free for all those who can afford to access it), SDG 14 will require international law and governance – and its enforcement – to extend right across the ocean.</p>
<div id="attachment_759" style="width: 1955px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/21774827281_dbb292c28a_k.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-759" class="wp-image-759 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/21774827281_dbb292c28a_k-e1455305774210.jpg" alt="U.S. President Barack Obama addresses the United Nations summit on September 27, 2015.

<p>High-sounding aspirations agreed to in New York are certainly no guarantee of action on the ground. Decades of broken promises testify to that. Indeed, much of what has just been agreed to in the SDGs sounds almost painfully familiar and many are justifiably cynical about the likelihood of achieving the transformation touted. But, at least for the ocean, the SDGs are a watershed moment.</p>
<p>The ocean has finally made the big time; after being side-lined in the Millennium Development Goals, marine conservation now enjoys equal billing with the traditional big issues like poverty eradication, health, education or climate change. This enhanced visibility can only be a good thing, but the real test will be the degree of influence the new global goal has on other complex negotiations and decisions, at global, regional and state level. Will SDG 14 make the leap from a big splash in New York to become the agent of a genuine sea change?</p>
<p>The good news is that the ocean SDG is a strong one, backed up by a set of seven specific and in many cases time-bound targets that tackle the key threats faced by the ocean, from illegal fishing to ocean acidification..</p>
<p>We need to seize this momentum, and reinforce SDG 14 with measurable and politically relevant indicators able to guide progress towards each of its specific targets. The Global Ocean Commission has put forward proposals for many of these indicators and is working to promote them.</p>
<p>For example, indicators of progress towards target 14.3, to “minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification,” could on one hand be ‘increased numbers of research programs dedicated to studying carbon sequestration,’ and on the other – and most immediately and effectively – be a strong outcome at the critical UNFCCC climate summit in Paris in December. If States are serious about minimizing ocean acidification, they must show themselves to be serious about accelerating action to cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, decarbonize the economy and head toward 100% renewables. A recent report commissioned by the Global Ocean Commission estimates that life in the high seas alone absorbs 500 million tonnes of carbon every year. Unless we reduce our emissions, ocean acidification and ocean warming will inevitably increase. Paris therefore looms as an early, and very tough, test of the real impact of the SDGs.</p>
<p>Another clear indicator of States willingness to action could be to have enough of them coming forward and ratifying the 2009 Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Port States Measures Agreement to permit this vitally important instrument for combatting illegal fishing (which Target 14.4 pledges to end) to finally enter into force. To be truly credible, the SDGs need to be reflected in legally binding instruments like the PSMA.</p>
<p>In the same month as the Paris climate challenge, States will have another opportunity to back up an SDG 14 target, this time number 14.6 to prohibit, by 2020, fisheries subsidies which contribute to over – and illegal fishing. The World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Nairobi is the time to start. About 60% of WTO members are willing to end the huge injustice whereby a handful of rich States subsidize their industrial fishing fleets – to the tune of tens of billions of dollars – to operate far from home at the expense of small-scale artisanal fishers. Eliminating these long-contested distorting subsidies will also help tackle the current chronic mismanagement of the world’s fisheries, which the World Bank estimates costs the global economy $83 billion a year!</p>

<p>Early signs of change are promising. In the days following the launch of the SDGs, the Prime Minister of New Zealand announced <a href="http://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Marine/MFE7910_A4_Brochure_LR.pdf">the creation of a vast new marine protected area</a> spanning 620,000km2, which will help progress towards Target 14.5 to conserve at least 10% of the ocean. Meanwhile, the Prime Ministers of two of the staunchest supporters of SDG 14, Fiji and Sweden, announced a joint proposal to establish a series of high-level UN Ocean conferences every three years, starting in 2017, to give visibility to and benchmark efforts to implement SDG14 and to maintain and increase political momentum for the ocean. The UN General Assembly will decide in a few weeks whether this proposal goes ahead or not.</p>
<p>The Global Ocean Commission is determined that SDG 14 is not permitted to sink into obscurity. If the ocean goal flounders, there will be little hope of achieving the others: there can be no food security, no reduction in global inequality, and no combatting of climate change without a healthy and resilient ocean.</p>
<p>SDG 14 is a cause for great celebration, but we cannot for a moment rest on our laurels. Reversing ocean decline, and building a strong and just system of ocean governance, is a major undertaking. It will take years of dedicated action. Our ocean deserves nothing less.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a Chinese restaurant in a Las Vegas strip mall, Austin Ayer tries to act nonchalant as he orders the most controversial item on the menu.</p>
<p>“Do you want crab in your shark fin soup?” asks the waiter. “It tastes much better.”</p>
<p>“No, just shark fin,” says Ayer. “And I’d like it to go.”</p>
<p>The waiter takes measure of the strapping university student, who, with his blue eyes and rosy cheeks, perhaps doesn’t fit the description of a typical shark fin soup customer. The waiter shrugs: “That’ll be $21.57.” Ayer hands over a credit card. He slowly exhales at the ringing of the cash register.</p>
<p>Minutes later in the parking lot, Ayer opens the pint-sized styrofoam container and pours some soup onto a tray in his makeshift mobile genetics laboratory: the back of his Scion hatchback. He quickly gets to work before his shark fin samples are compromised. “I need to get this out of the hot broth and onto ice as soon as possible,” he says.</p>
<p>Fishing around with long metal forceps, he pulls out chunks of meat. “This looks like crab,” he says. “That’s not what we want.” He sets it aside and teases long, elastic, translucent noodle-like strips from the broth: they look like the tendons that give shark fins their strength. “This is looking better. Here we go.”</p>

(Credit: Kenneth R. Weiss)</p></div>
<p>He washes a few of the filaments with a squirt of distilled water and tucks them in a test tube with an enzyme solution for later genetic tests. If all goes well, the telltale DNA inside the stringy bits will reveal whether the soup contained shark species banned under international law.</p>
<p>Genetic identification has become faster, cheaper, and more reliable in recent years, with advances coming so quickly that even enterprising undergraduates like Ayer can now fashion themselves as DNA detectives. In the not-too-distant future, next-generation sequencing—which allows machines to read millions of gene sequences in one batch—and the promise of a rapid or instant DNA test will transform much of what we know about life in the sea and how fast we can know it.</p>
<p>Combined, these quantum jumps in technology will provide exacting ways to measure if the seafood supply is safe and honest, offer biologists new methods to track elusive endangered species, and empower regulators with instant forensic evidence to crack down on illegal wildlife trafficking or determine the species of fish caught in nets far from shore. And if breakthroughs continue apace, consumers will soon be able to deputize themselves as genetic gumshoes, testing the halibut on their plate to quickly determine if it really is halibut, no matter if it has been filleted, frozen, or fried.</p>
<p>At the center of this revolution is an ID system that uses a snippet of DNA sequence data that belongs to a particular species, with the ambition to build a digital catalogue that includes every species on Earth. These distinct sequences, named DNA barcodes after the familiar black and white stripes on products scanned at the supermarket, are stored on centralized databases. When researchers isolate the right DNA sequence from a new tissue sample, it can be compared to all identified species on file to see if it’s a match. So far, more than 11,000 fish have been ID’d and catalogued within the <a href="http://www.fishbol.org">Fish Barcode of Life</a> computerized repository. It’s part of a larger effort, the <a href="http://www.ibol.org/">International Barcode of Life</a> (iBOL), which has analyzed close to five million samples representing more than 525,000 different species on land and at sea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the race is on to provide a rapid DNA test that Paul Hebert, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Guelph in Ontario and scientific director of iBOL, likens to the handheld “tricorder” used on Star Trek to boldly scan and identify life forms throughout the sci-fi universe. “That’s the world we are heading to,” he says, “reading all forms of life like people read thermometers.” Having this futuristic handheld technology would shorten the time from sample to positive species ID, a system that now requires samples to be sent to a lab for processing and DNA sequencing before they can be compared to a database such as the Fish Barcode of Life.</p>

<p>In a reflective moment, Hebert acknowledges that Spock’s tricorder might not be a perfect comparison because it doesn’t require a tissue sample or even skin contact. “From that standpoint, it’s wrong technically,” he says. “You don’t have that much DNA floating in the air.”</p>
<p>That’s not a problem in the oceans. Fish and other marine creatures regularly slough cells in seawater, leaving telltale environmental DNA (eDNA) in the area that can be read through next-generation sequencing. By processing some water samples, Hebert says, the new technology can “read all of the species that have been in that water that day.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, for example, researchers released the results of the four-year seafaring Tara Expedition, which collected eDNA instead of museum specimens to glean new insights into the interactions of millions of species of plankton, from viruses to microscopic animals.</p>
<p>What’s remarkable is that until the 1970s, scientists didn’t know most of these microbes existed in ocean waters because they couldn’t see them, says Stephen R. Palumbi, a marine biologist at Stanford University<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>“Next-generation sequencing is one of the most astounding breakthroughs in biology in the past 20 or 30 years,” says Palumbi, adding that its potential is just beginning to emerge. Federal government researchers are using it to track elusive porpoises in Alaska and determine if rare spring-run Chinook salmon are making it into the headwaters of the Columbia River. Some scientists are collecting eDNA from ocean water to assess every species that lives in a marine reserve. Others are experimenting with paring eDNA, which identifies which fish are present, with acoustic data from fish-finding sonar to estimate their abundance. Such experiments seek a non-lethal way to survey fish populations, rather than traditional method of catching fish in a trawl net and counting them when they are dead.</p>
<p>It’s possible that one day soon, a fisheries manager who wants to check on commercial catch could rinse a fisherman’s net and scan the rinse water for a genetic signature of every kind of fish that had been caught. That’s on Palumbi’s long to-do list. “Extracting the data is easy,” he says. The hard part, he adds, is finding a commercial fisherman who will allow an outsider to wash his nets for genetic scrutiny.</p>
<p>Palumbi, who is also director of Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California, has been a pioneer in using genetics in marine biology, including taking the lab on the road. He and colleagues repeatedly set up a surreptitious DNA laboratory in a Tokyo hotel room throughout the 1990s that revealed how Japan’s whalers were violating international law by hunting and selling the meat of humpback, blue, gray, fin, and other great whales—far beyond their limited permit to take minke whales for “scientific research.”</p>

<p>Initially, their methodology and findings were denounced by the whaling industry, yet Japan’s government soon cracked down on contraband and mislabeled meat.</p>
<p>“When we started testing whale meat, the process was tedious and laborious,” Palumbi says. “All that is changing with the new technology. It’s easier, cheaper, and more reliable. A high school freshman could do it, if we showed her how.” But could he teach a journalist to do it?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My stint as a temporary lab tech began two months before I went shark fin shopping in Las Vegas with Ayer. I’m driving north toward Pacific Grove when my phone chirps with a text from Palumbi: “Don’t forget your homework.” It’s late and the sushi bars will be closing soon, thwarting my assignment to deliver fresh sushi for sequencing the next morning. A Japanese restaurant beckons from alongside the highway and I find myself sitting at a sushi bar directly beneath the stern gaze of a muscular sushi chef.</p>
<p>Palumbi has his students test their sushi as a primer to DNA sequencing. He says it’s remarkable how often salmon turns out to be trout, flounder gets sold as sand dab, various white fish are billed as cod, and red snapper, or even halibut, is switched out for cheaper farmed tilapia. Restaurants, especially sushi bars, are apparently the worst offenders. Palumbi’s instructions? Bring at least six different types of fish to the lab, and keep them fresh.</p>

(Credit: Kenneth R. Weiss)</p></div>
<p>I order the biggest sashimi platter on the menu, a colorful display of 24 slices of six kinds of fish, asking the chef to point out the various pieces on the plate. He rattles off the names so fast, it’s hard to keep track. As a self-styled sushi sleuth, I need to maintain chain of custody for each sample, getting the assigned names, so I can verify species by their genes. It’s impossible to catch the eye of the busy chef to pose a question, so I wave the menu and begin ordering side dishes. Each time he hands me a new plate, I hold up another piece of sashimi, asking, “What is this?” Soon he’s grumbling in Japanese. When I’m sure I’ve almost worn out my welcome, I give him a big smile and ask for a to-go container. He thrusts a styrofoam box at me without a word. I organize my catalogued specimens in the box, then push my luck and ask for a plastic bag filled with ice. He ignores my question and instead calls out to one of the servers, and, pointing to me, yells, “Check!”</p>
<p>The next morning, the Palumbi Lab emerges from the fog in the heart of the Hopkins Marine Station, which is perched on a rocky point overlooking the churning Pacific Ocean next to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The lab is already full of busy students by the time I arrive at 8:30 a.m. with my samples on ice.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day, I follow Palumbi’s tedious 19-step recipe for preparing tissues for DNA sequencing. It begins with tugging on purple gloves, and using sterile needles to dig out a tiny piece of fish flesh—smaller than a grain of rice—and easing it to a test tube filled with solution. It’s delicate work and, after a half-dozen of these sushi surgeries, I stick myself with a sharp needle and bleed all over the lab.</p>
<p>Aside from helping me staunch the bleeding, Palumbi is a hands-off instructor. First, I dose the samples with the enzyme proteinase K to chemically chew up the tissue and release the DNA. Then, I follow more than a dozen more steps before I load the tubes—now filled with clear liquid—into a sophisticated apparatus the size of a home bread machine where they’re “baked” with the chemical instructions to make thousands of copies of the tiny piece of DNA for easier identification.</p>
<p>All this has to happen before I can send my samples for sequencing. The results come back a few days later via email: each sample translated into a long string of the letters A, T, C, and G—abbreviations for the nucleotide bases that are the building blocks of DNA—each sequence between 570 and 650 characters long. It looks like a child has maniacally typed the letters in random fashion over and over. One by one, I cut and paste the results and enter them into the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) on the National Institute of Health website, to see what I had actually eaten. It takes only seconds to compare the sequences to all of the DNA data collected around the world.</p>

<p>The salmon checks out, as do most of the other pieces. Then I load up the sequence for the ono, also known as wahoo by sports fishermen who revere this bigtasty fish, and send it to BLAST. Six seconds later, I have my answer. It isn’t ono, but a snake mackerel called escolar that has earned the nickname “Ex-lax fish.” Italy and Japan have banned escolar because it contains gempylotoxin, an indigestible wax that can bring on violent cramping and orange diarrhea.</p>
<p>Escolar is often sold as white tuna or by other names in sushi bars, according to conservation organization Oceana’s genetic testing in 2013, which showed a third of seafood was mislabeled in American restaurants and markets. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not banned escolar, but advises against its sale. The FDA got more involved in seafood mislabeling in 2007, when toxic pufferfish from China was sold as monkfish, sickening people and sending at least one to hospital. Since then, it has installed DNA sequencing machines in nine regional laboratories, and set up its own DNA library of the 700 or so most commonly eaten fish—with each barcode tagged to a species identified by expert taxonomists. Rigorous chain of custody is required so federal investigators can prosecute fraudulent mislabeling with DNA evidence that will stand up in court.</p>
<p>Bait-and-switch tactics, such as substituting cheap Vietnamese farmed swai, similar to catfish, for more expensive “red snapper,” remains common among imports that now make up more than 90 percent of US seafood consumption. Federal inspectors struggle to keep up with the flow of fish, much of it arriving after being processed at sea and hard to visually identify. The DNA analysis helps, but the process can be slow and cumbersome as inspectors collect samples, bring them to regional labs and then wait—for days or longer—for the results.</p>

<p>“I would love to see a portable sequencer and rapid extractors,” says Jonathan R. Deeds, principal investigator of the FDA’s genetics project to combat fish fraud. In the meantime, the FDA has experimented with the University of Guelph’s <a href="//itunes.apple.com/us/app/lifescanner-fda-edition/id950330936?mt=8">Lifescanner App</a>, which could quickly transmit test results from inspectors carrying tablets or smartphones to regional labs and FDA headquarters once such rapid DNA tests become reality.</p>
<p>Government and private industry are racing to further technologies that will ultimately help to positively identify fish and other species by their genes on the spot. The US Army’s biosecurity labs at Fort Detrick in Maryland, for instance, are researching methods to instantly identify anthrax and other pathogens. And commercial biomedical research firms are working on the technology, hoping to cash in on quick diagnosis for common bacteria and viruses that plague human patients. There’s even an early version of a handheld unit, developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies in England.</p>
<p>A cottage industry has emerged, with genetic testing companies offering to help restaurants, fish mongers, and seafood distributors clean up their supply chain to avoid running afoul of the law or facing hefty fines. And some researchers are identifying more elaborate genetic markers that go beyond ID’ing the species to differentiate among various populations so scientists can determine where the fish are caught. A consortium of European researchers uses genetics to trace the geographic origin of cod, for instance, whether it’s caught legally or plundered from overfished waters.</p>
<p>Kathy Moore, forensic biologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Charleston, South Carolina, expects that eventually it will become cost-effective to identify genetic profiles for an individual high-priced fish, such as a big blue fin tuna—essentially having a DNA tag that will follow the fish from the boat to the plate. Moore, who works with a <a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ia/iuu/taskforce.html">presidential task force</a> to combat illegal fishing and seafood fraud, has spent decades helping prosecute sea turtle poaching cases, sometimes relying on little more than swabs of turtle blood off baseball bats, knives, and spears that were matched against NOAA’s own curated DNA database of protected species.</p>
<p>All these genetic tests are complex variations of what I am doing in the Palumbi Lab. During my day there, I work alongside Austin Ayer, who is diving into his shark fin science project. While I process my sushi dinner leftovers, he snips and prepares tiny pieces from fins left in the lab’s freezer from when Palumbi used to send his students to Chinatown in San Francisco to purchase shark parts for DNA identification. That was before California banned their sale in 2013, a reaction to the barbaric practice of cutting off a shark’s fins and throwing the writhing animal overboard to bleed to death. Shark populations have plummeted around the world, in large part to meet the demand for shark fin soup, a luxury dish in Chinese culture that has become a symbol of status and wealth.</p>
<p>Inspired by Palumbi’s success in shaking up the Japanese whaling industry, Ayer wanted to do something similar, but only had a summer to tackle a project for his senior honors thesis and still graduate on time. So he settled on trying to replicate the pioneering methods of a <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114844">study</a> published in February 2015 that showed that even in places where shark fin soup is legal, it often contains fins from sharks that are illegally traded. The study found fins of two types of hammerheads in soup purchased in the United States, and managed to identify seven out of eight types of endangered sharks—including whale sharks, basking sharks, and great whites—that are illegal to ship across borders without a permit.</p>

<p>Palumbi approved Ayer’s project. Yet one hurdle remained. When California banned possession of shark fins, getting samples was no longer a convenient matter. So to find the closest place that has a concentration of restaurants with customers willing to shell out handsomely for a high-priced status symbol in a small bowl, Ayer needs to cross state lines.</p>
<p>“I never thought I’d be going to Las Vegas,” he says, “to do field research in marine biology.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before Ayer picks me up along the eight-hour drive to Sin City, he calls every Chinese restaurant in Vegas he can find that reputedly sells shark fin soup. Few show shark fin soup on their online menus, yet, in reality, most of them offer it. Quietly. To those who ask. Prices range from US $20 to $300 a bowl. But would they sell it to him?</p>
<p>Ayer asks Palumbi for guidance, given that his professor has experience buying strange things from the sea for genetic analysis. “It won’t be the weirdest thing that happens in Las Vegas that night,” Palumbi advises him. He suggests that Ayer simply use his chopsticks at the table to pull out shark fin filaments and put them in test tubes. Ayer has another plan: “Ideally, we get as many orders to go as we can.”</p>
<p>The first test comes in the Chinese restaurant in the Vegas strip mall. It’s 37 °C and Ayer opens the restaurant’s double glass doors to a blast of air conditioning. The restaurant is nearly empty. “We are about to find out if this is going to work,” Ayer says under his breath.</p>
<p>After making a successful buy and processing the samples in the sunbaked parking lot, Ayer repeats the routine at another local establishment in Las Vegas’s Chinatown. Then he is ready to hit the Strip. Ayer calculates that his research grant will cover 11 soup samples, provided he limits himself to mid-range prices, nothing more than $70 a bowl. It’s time to go to a high-end joint where discriminating customers would insist that shark fin is the real deal.</p>

<p>Oversized chandeliers, obsequious waiters, and white tablecloths greet our arrival at Jasmine, the Chinese restaurant inside the Bellagio hotel and casino. Plush curtains and valances frame the window overlooking the lighted fountains that dance in the desert night to synchronized music. Shark fin is nowhere on the pricy menu. Ayer orders spring rolls to buy a little time.</p>
<p>When a waitress comes by, Ayer learns the restaurant offers three versions of the soup: the basic, for $60, and the deluxe with a two-ounce clump of shark fin tendons for $150, or a three-ounce clump for $180. Not a high roller, Ayer orders the basic</p>
<p>As soon as it arrives, Ayer receives a text from a friend who needs a pickup at the airport. He snags the server and asks for a to-go cup. The soup is whisked away and returned in a fancy white cardboard box with Bellagio’s looping serif logo. Within minutes, he’s processing the sample in the back of the Scion in the Bellagio’s stifling hot covered parking lot, breathing fumes of the trapped auto exhaust.</p>
<p>We’ve picked up Ayer’s friend and it’s getting late, but Ayer is hoping for one more sample. The Beijing Noodle No. 9 at Caesars Palace is just across the street. It’s almost closing time and the hostess does not want to seat us, but then a gregarious server wearing black-rimmed attitude glasses allows us inside, asking us to order quickly before the kitchen shuts down. He recommends the Singapore noodles and General Tso’s chicken. We accept, but Ayer also asks for shark fin soup. It isn’t on the menu, but the waiter confirms it’s available—a small bowl for $99 and a bowl with a fin for $199—but he has some advice: “Skip it. It’s not worth it. If you asked for it, I don’t think I’d sell it to you. They cut off the fin and let the shark die. It’s so mean.” Ayer skips it. The price is way out of his range.</p>
<p>We close down the Beijing Noodle, head to the Strip for a midnight beer, and then crash for the night at a budget motel. The next morning, we part ways and Ayer spends that day and evening collecting more soup and samples before making the long drive back to the Pacific Grove lab, two ice-packed coolers with his carefully preserved samples in the hatch.</p>

<p>In this forensic work, obtaining and preserving samples with intact DNA is critical: DNA degrades as tissues break down, shattering the long strands into smaller and smaller pieces until they are too short and fragmented to be useful. The challenge facing researchers scrutinizing shark fins is to find a short strand that will survive all of the insults—drying, bleaching, boiling in soup—but one that’s long enough so that they have the information needed to identify a specific species. By Monday morning, Ayer is struggling with the initial round of results from his Las Vegas samples, picking up DNA from other ingredients added for flavor. “There’s tons of DNA in the soup,” he tells me, “[but] half the time, it comes back as pig, or chicken, or crab, or shrimp.”</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, Ayer keeps working on the samples—extracting the DNA and sending it off for sequencing. The results? He was able to isolate enough genetic information to identify the species of shark from every soup he purchased. But one DNA barcode stood out from the rest. It came from a scalloped hammerhead, a warm-water shark so endangered that it has joined the list of species illegal to trade internationally. The discovery left him with mixed feelings of sadness and excitement. “It’s a double-edged sword,” Ayer says. “It’s a bummer to find endangered species. But it makes my project more compelling, a more interesting story to tell.”</p>
<p>The global demand for shark fin soup is driving scalloped hammerheads toward extinction. This shark, with its bizarre head shaped like a sci-fi spaceship, is targeted because its large fins are loaded with ropy strands of collagen that are prized by consumers. The restaurant probably had no idea it was serving the fin of an endangered shark. The distributor was also likely unaware, as were perhaps others in the supply chain that passed through Hong Kong, a hub of the global trade. Short of a global ban on shark fin soup, how can the sharks most threatened with extinction be saved? And can genetics play a role in the solution?</p>
<p>Palumbi considers genetics an insightful tool that can penetrate the most opaque aspects of the seafood market, whether properly identifying whale meat in a Tokyo display case, a box of fish fillets arriving on the docks in Los Angeles, or a fin swimming in a bowl of soup in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before we were blind,” Palumbi says, “but now we can see: DNA technology gives us a vision of what’s in that bowl of soup. Sometimes we find out bad things, but that makes us double down to fix those problems. It’s not just a bowl of soup, but a bowl with strands from an endangered species swirling around. And once we find that out, we can do something about it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Hawaii experienced an unexpected coral bleaching event in the fall of 2014, reef managers went out to see the hardest hit reefs. A response team was sent to Kaneohe Bay, Oahu to survey the effects of thermal stress. Since Hawaiian reefs had only bleached once years before, little was known about how the relatively pristine reefs would fare. As Hawaii prepared for another bleaching event in 2015, scientists there were learning more about reef recovery than ever before.</p>
<p>This level of post-bleaching surveying is possible because of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch (CRW) program’s newest coral bleaching monitoring tool. Publicly available online, the satellite mapping product is a marked improvement for monitoring and predicting bleaching events.</p>
<p>It also has major implications for management: Will predictive bleaching forecasts allow reef managers to respond to coral bleaching more effectively?</p>
<div id="attachment_513" style="width: 1244px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/kelsey1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-513" class="size-full wp-image-513" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/kelsey1.png" alt="Great Barrier Reef, 2014; Credit: XL Catlin Seaview Survey" width="1234" height="609" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-513" class="wp-caption-text">Only two years later: Great Barrier Reef, 2014; Credit: XL Catlin Seaview Survey</p></div>
<p>Right now CRW is recording the third global bleaching event at a finer resolution than was ever possible in the past. It&#8217;s a global event, since consistently warming water temperatures have led to mass coral bleaching in all three of the world&#8217;s major oceans. The first two events, one in 1998 and the other in 2010, were somewhat spaced out, but scientists predict they&#8217;ll become more frequent.</p>
<p>When water temperatures increase an average of two degrees, corals lose the algae that gives them their color. By bleaching, their white skeleton is exposed. Without that symbiotic algae, most corals struggle to feed themselves and can die when turf algae takes over. Corals can recover, but if stressful conditions like warm water temperatures persist the odds are unlikely.</p>
<p>With the ability to create daily 5 kilometer (km) resolution bleaching warning maps, the new monitoring product provides much finer details than its 50-km predecessor. “Managers needed finer details, since most reefs are pretty small, and they wanted predictions about the potential for future bleaching events,” says Mark Eakin, coordinator of the CRW program. By using more satellites and climate models, the monitoring tool can provide detailed daily reports and seasonal outlooks.</p>

<h2><strong>How it’s used </strong></h2>
<p>To make this data user-friendly, CRW created virtual stations for the hundreds of reef managers, scientists, and researchers that use this data all around the world. By designating recognizable places like Maui or and parts of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef as virtual stations, stakeholders can quickly identify places of interest. They subscribe to an email alert system that notifies them when that reef is experiencing stress.</p>
<p>Based on NOAA&#8217;s latest climate predictions, the reports can give some insight into what’s coming months down the line. “Managers love it. We can show week by week what the probability of bleaching for the next four months is,” says Eakin. “They can’t tell you exactly what’s going to happen, but they’re good predictors.”</p>
<p>They’ve been especially useful for field monitoring in Hawaii.  “While we may have not developed a management solution to bleaching, we gathered crucial information about how coral in Hawaii responds to thermal stress and recovers,” says Anne Rosinski, a marine resources specialist at Hawaii’s Division of Aquatic Resources. The 5-km data allowed them to pinpoint specific locations where bleaching was the worst, so they could focus limited field monitoring resources there. Coral bleaching is complicated by Hawaii’s highly variable topography and geology, so having finer details makes monitoring easier there.</p>
<p>Bleaching is the result of global processes that are warming the earth’s oceans, so prevention isn’t possible even if it can be predicted months before.</p>
<p>“Warnings allow us to get ready to record what happens, the death of corals, or if we are lucky, their survival, since they can bleach and recover if it doesn’t get too hot for too long,” says Douglas Fenner, a contractor that monitors American Samoa’s reefs for NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). “We will have the best documented dead reefs the world has ever known.”</p>
<h2><strong>The value of mitigation techniques </strong></h2>
<p>Despite not being able to stop bleaching, the CRW data could help with deciding where to focus response efforts. Shade clothes that float on the water could shield reefs from direct sunlight and limit heating from that radiation. Pumping cooler water from lower depths up to reefs could keep them cooler too. But both methods would be expensive. Many scientists are skeptical about small-scale techniques like this, but others feel they’re practical to use on highly-valued reefs.</p>
<p>Building local resilience seems more plausible; it’s done by minimizing human impacts like tourism, fishing, and agricultural and industrial runoff. This approach has been used for years, but the world’s reefs are still bleaching at alarming rates. “For everything that humans do that damage reefs, some people benefit,” says Fenner. Over 100 countries around the world benefit from reef tourism alone. While economically important, most reefs are exploited.</p>
<p>Yet there is value in being able to identify the strongest reefs through field monitoring like managers in Hawaii are doing. “Some areas might have natural protection, so we can make their survival even more likely by limiting fishing and boat traffic,” says Eakin. With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) future climate scenarios, scientists can identify the best places for long-term conservation efforts too.</p>
<h2><strong>The benefits of long-term planning for conservation</strong></h2>
<p>Reefs can and do bounce back from bleaching events. In 1998 a strong El Nino caused a large bleaching event on western Australia’s Scott Reef. But over the next 15 years the reef came back. A combination of fish that had never been seen at the reef before ate the turf algae that took over the coral skeleton, allowing the corals to recover to nearly the same levels as before the bleaching, though some older ones did die.</p>
<p>Located about 600 km from shore and 1000 km from any major city, the reef was far from civilization. “That shows us how nature has the ability to bounce back from an injury if we leave it alone,” says Eakin. Overuse is one of reasons that reefs in the Caribbean and Great Barrier Reef haven’t been as successful at recovering from bleaching events.</p>
<p>So, is there value in just being able to monitor reefs to inform long-term planning? If it leads to effective marine policy that promotes conservation, then yes. “Approaching marine management from a proactive instead of reactive way allows us to get ahead of the issues,” says Jason Vasques, programs director for the Coral Reef Alliance. Marine policies could halt fishing, tourism, or construction near a reef that is about to bleach or even prevent all of those activities from taking place if the reefs are in a protected area. That at least gives the reef a better chance of recovering.</p>
<p>CRW is a useful predictive monitoring tool and can help managers gain support for conservation, but the global processes that cause widespread bleaching can’t be ignored. The IPCC predicts that by 2050 mass bleaching will occur on a yearly basis, a trend we’re already beginning to see. Stakeholders know that only an international agreement can make a difference. “Just maybe there will be enough political will at upcoming climate change meetings to make a difference,” says Eakin. “Our reefs really do depend on it.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Will there be a day when the seafood on your plate has been certified as sustainable, toxin-free and exploitation-free and has been tracked from the time it was hooked to the time it is purchased? Will this information be verified by satellites from the sky that have cross-referenced errant transmissions and have correlated them with reports from an at-sea observer? Will every flag-state inspect the fishing vessels under their jurisdiction for compliance with international regulations to prove clean ownership, transparent operations and vessel seaworthiness? Will conservation, followed by technology and innovation be the prime motivators within the fishing industry thereby reducing wastage and promoting conservation?</p>
<p>Today we are a long way from being able to answer even one of these questions in the affirmative, exposing the vast divide between the principles of the conventions being ratified at the United Nations and the practicality in achieving their goals. Why it is so hard – if not impossible – to achieve a positive response to all those questions? The case of one particular fishing vessel provides some clues.</p>

<p>Fishing in the Southern Ocean is regulated by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), one of the seventeen Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) that regulate fishing in various ocean regions across the world. In short, the RFMO consists of interested member countries that flag and operate vessels that fish under the conditions of RFMO permits and report back to ensure a complete feedback system is in place.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, a global market began to develop for Chilean Seabass and there was a rush to fish the rich waters of the Southern Ocean. By the mid-1990s, the illegal catch of Chilean Seabass outweighed those caught legally under CCAMLR, or under national jurisdiction. Strict actions were quickly taken under the CCAMLR to stamp out a bulk of the unsanctioned activity, but six vessels took advantage of legal loopholes and continued to illegally fish inside the controlled waters of the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>The <em>Thunder</em> was one such vessel. She had largely employed some, or all, of the measures listed below to remain beyond the full reach of the current law:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using Flags of Non Compliance: Flagging ships to non-member countries and thereby attaining the status of “Unregulated.” The <em>Thunder</em> flew the flags of Togo, Mongolia, Seychelles, Belize and Nigeria, none of them members of the CCAMLR.</li>
<li>Fishing in the high seas: Fishing in regions where no internationally binding laws apply and therefore acting outside the enforcement regime of the RFMO member-countries. Between 2006 and 2014, the <em>Thunder</em> was sighted a total of eighteen times. She was either fishing in or transiting through the high seas region of the CCAMLR management region.</li>
<li>Calling ports with relaxed enforcement regimes: Landing catch at ports with very relaxed port state controls in South East Asia and Africa, thus ensuring that the vessels are not inspected when landing their catch, while at the same time accessing port facilities to refuel, re-stock and change crew. The <em>Thunder </em>called ports in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Mauritius over the years. She was inspected in Malaysia in 2013 and was found to have on board a cargo of illegally caught Patagonian toothfish. The captain and crew of the <em>Thunder</em> were fined $AU90,000 &#8211; only a fraction of the $US60 million that Interpol estimated that ship’s owners have earned from the vessel’s illegal catch since 2006. Having paid the fine, the crew and ship were later released along with their illegal catch, and they subsequently returned to the Southern Ocean.</li>
<li>Employing additional techniques: Using the invisibility in the oceans to hide the true identity of the vessel by forging documents, hopping flags, changing names and operating under shell companies thereby hiding beneficial ownership. The <em>Thunder</em> swapped names between <em>Rubin, Typhoon I, Kuko, Wuhan No. 4, Ming No. 5</em><em>, </em>and over the years changed ownership at least seven times.</li>

<p>Today the <em>Thunder</em> does not exist. She was found fishing illegally within the high seas of the Southern Ocean on December 17, 2014 by the marine conservation group, Sea Shepherd. Operating under the UN World Charter for Nature, Sea Shepherd is well known for its direct-action approach to conservation. With the mandate to uphold international conservation law, Sea Shepherd intervenes to stop environmental crimes that impact the marine environment, in situations where those responsible for law enforcement are unable to, or refuse to, uphold those laws.</p>
<p>Over the next 109 days, the <em>Thunder</em> remained on the high seas, traveling a distance of 10,000 nautical miles from the Southern Ocean to the Indian Ocean and round the Cape of Good Hope to the South Atlantic Ocean, effectively remaining outside the reach of the world’s navies. She moved freely despite being subject to a Purple Notice by Interpol and a reputation for being the world’s most notorious poacher. In early April 2015, the vessel was deliberately sunk by her captain in the waters of São Tomé and Príncipe, a tiny West African island country.</p>

<p><em>The</em> <em>Thunder</em> case study presents three distinct facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Illegal vessels do not hide behind a shroud of secrecy. In fact they exist because they remain beyond the full reach of the law.</li>
<li>The illegality within the fishing industry exists because of the maze of countries involved, most often with outdated legal instruments to keep pace with the current industry and a non-harmonization of regulations.</li>
<li>A woeful lack of enforcement and in proactive patrols exists on the world’s oceans. During a recent address in Chile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry sighted the case of the <em>Thunder</em> and commented that, “there are millions of square miles of oceans that are unregulated and that you have unscrupulous people who are chasing the money.” He further added, “The responsibility of pursuing pirate ships cannot be left to environmental groups,” highlighting a need for consensus on greater enforcement mechanisms.</li>

<p>The <em>Thunder</em> case study highlights the importance of at-sea patrols. To achieve true marine conservation, the world needs an ocean governed by laws that can be monitored and enforced. Until lofty principles can be practicably enforced and the questions posed at the beginning of this article be affirmatively answered, on-the-scene enforcement, which stops crimes as they are taking place, remains the most effective tool to target illegal activity on the world’s oceans. And while regulatory grey areas, a lack of resources, and a lack of government will continue to plague maritime law, leading to ineffective enforcement on the high seas, organisations such as Sea Shepherd will continue to play a vital role filling this law enforcement gap.</p>
<p>Consequences for non-compliance must be swift and binding, as it is not the scale of the punishment, but the certainty of it that acts as the biggest deterrent to crime. Currently, the vastness of the high seas and overlaps and gaps between regional and international jurisdictional responsibilities remain a challenge to marine law enforcement. However, recent moves towards international cooperation on fisheries crimes indicate that momentum is building to tackle the challenges, head-on.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Easter Island is best known for its mysterious Moai statues, which dominate part of the hilly coastline and stare at the horizon like ancient watchmen of the once bountiful ocean. Just beyond the reach of their gaze lies a large stretch of open water, known as the high seas, that provides a vital spawning ground for many overfished and highly migratory species, including tuna and sharks.</p>
<p>The seas were once plentiful, notes Alberto Hotus, president of the Easter Island Elder’s Council, who fondly remembers when a fishing boat could easily bring back enough to feed the whole island. “[This] does not happen anymore,” he says with a hint of sadness. “There are no tuna, no fish.”</p>
<p>Residents of the island, also known as Rapa Nui, have long claimed that vessels are fishing illegally in their waters. Many local fishermen attest to seeing the distant glimmer of foreign vessel lights at night.</p>
<p>“People on the island have been complaining about illegal fishing for years,” says Marta Hotus, the governor of Easter Island. Evidence of these activities, such as buoys and long nets—fishing gear that is not used by the locals—even regularly washed ashore.</p>
<p>The Rapa Nui people once used their celestial-based navigation skills to “conquer the islands by navigating across the seas,” says Mayor Pedro Pablo Edmunds Paoa. He describes them as the “Phoenicians of the Pacific,” referring to the ancient Mediterranean civilization renown for having mastered deep-sea navigation, covering great distances in their ships of trade and war.</p>

<p>But the illustrious navigational past of the Rapa Nui alone is no match for the industrial scale of illegal fishing operations. Nor can it reverse the impact on the livelihoods of a community whose very survival has long been tied to the ocean’s bounty.</p>
<p>“What I see in the sea makes me sad because I see fishermen go out and come back with nothing,” says Sara Roe, president of the Hanga Piko fishing association on Easter Island. “Coming back with nothing means that they won’t have bread for their kids, there will be no food for the household, so that is a problem for the people.”</p>
<p>The case of Easter Island partly demonstrates the difficulties faced by governments in monitoring remote areas of the high seas, which in turn become fertile ground for illegal fishing operations. Governments around the world have recognized the scale of the problem and are seeking solutions, but their resources vary enormously.</p>
<p>What role can advances in technology play in putting an end to illegal activities on the high seas that pillage an estimated $23.5 billion worth of fish each year? Because, let’s face it &#8211; trying to look for illegal fishing activities taking place across an area covering half the planet is akin to looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>The answer, some companies say, is by monitoring the seas from the sky.</p>
<p>Stuart Martin, CEO of the U.K.-based firm Satellite Applications Catapult, says that satellite data is now playing a “key role” in helping to end illegal fishing activities. It’s also helping to make the protection of livelihoods in many villages a “reality rather than an idealistic goal.”</p>
<p>John Amos, president of the U.S. non-profit group SkyTruth, agrees. Satellite data and real-time vessel tracking, he says, is “evolving quickly” and “shining a light on the commercial fleet that has been operating largely out of sight since humans first sailed over the horizon.&#8221;</p>

<h2><strong>Out of sight, out of mind </strong></h2>
<p>Located some 4,000 kilometers (2,300 miles) west of Chile, Easter Island’s isolated location coupled with the vast size of its surrounding ocean makes it vulnerable to illegal fishing—a criminal activity taking place on a global scale, fueled in part by the assumption that no one is watching. With the advent of more affordable space-based satellite technologies and their pioneering integration into custom monitoring platforms, there are more eyes than ever on the sea.</p>
<p>“The big change in the last few years that will accelerate into the future is the reduced costs of launching and developing highly effective satellites. As the number and usefulness of satellites increases, more data is available for effective monitoring,” explains Brad Soule, Senior Fisheries Analyst at Catapult’s Ocean Sustainability Business Unit.</p>
<p>As the Rapa Nui community became increasingly concerned with threats to their ocean environment, so did conservation groups, who sought an innovative way to answer their call for greater protection. SkyTruth, an organization that specializes in satellite-based remote sensing technologies, was soon enlisted by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Bertarelli Foundation to monitor and identify the best ways to protect the island’s waters.</p>
<p>The information compiled as part of the project prompted the Chilean Navy to increase its patrol efforts of the province. Likewise, in late 2015, the findings contributed to the announcement of a 631,368 square kilometers (243,630 square miles) marine park around the area, now considered to be the third-largest fully protected area of ocean in the world.</p>
<p>“In early 2012, Pew contacted us to ask if it was possible to monitor the activity of ships – including fishing vessels – in the waters of Easter Island Province,” said John Amos, an expert in using satellite images, aerial photographs and other kinds of remote sensing and digital mapping.</p>
<p>He had founded SkyTruth in 2001.</p>
<p>In January 2013, they began a monitoring program that used satellite radar images to detect the presence of ships, and satellite-collected Automatic Identification System (AIS) broadcasts to identify those vessels. At the time, this was the first instance of these two different technologies being combined in this way to monitor a country’s waters for illegal fishing activity.</p>

<p>Data collected between January and October 2013, including 163 satellite images, detected 73 vessels in and around Easter Island’s waters. Of these, 31 were identified using AIS (to include 22 cargo ships, 5 fishing vessels, 1 cruise ship, and 3 undefined). More than half (the remaining 42 vessels) could not be identified using their AIS broadcasts, but based on their size and location were determined by SkyTruth to be commercial fishing vessels. More than half of those vessels (a total of 25) were detected within Easter Island’s Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>
<h2><strong>Knowing where to look</strong></h2>
<p>“To stop illegal fishing and other crimes taking place on the ocean, authorities first need to be able to recognize and track vessels,” argues Pew’s Tony Long in his article “Satellite Tracking Can Unmask Illegal Fishing Vessels.” The former British naval commander now directs the organization’s <em>Ending Illegal Fishing Project.</em></p>
<p>Unlike mobile phones or cars, fishing vessels are not required to have an identification number. This means that identifying vessels at sea is not a straightforward exercise and requires the integration of differing but complimentary tools into a monitoring platform.</p>
<p>So how does it work?</p>
<p>The monitoring project conducted off Easter Island, for example, pioneered the combined use of two key tools—radar imagery and the Automatic Identification System (AIS)—to track and identify vessels.</p>
<p>Radar satellites can identify ships by beaming microwave (radar) energy down at the Earth’s surface and collecting the energy that is reflected back toward the satellite. According to SkyTruth’s Amos, steel-hulled ships are “strong reflectors of microwave energy and appear as very bright targets or radar images of the ocean.”</p>
<p>This allows for the observation of vessel activities without their participation or knowledge, an especially vital tool for ships that deliberately switch off their transceivers in order to avoid detection or don’t have them installed.</p>
<p>These radar images can yield basic information, including the exact location of a vessel at the moment the image was acquired, its approximate size and in some cases, the direction it’s moving. “But there is little information in a radar image that allows us to identify the vessel, or determine if it’s a fishing vessel rather than a cargo ship or other type of ship,” says Amos.</p>

<p>To fill the gap, SkyTruth combined radar satellite imagery with a second monitoring component known as a satellite-collected Automatic Identification System (AIS)—a form of automatic transceiver similar to a global positioning system (GPS) that is broadcast by vessels. Unlike other transceivers, such as the government-controlled Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), AIS was not designed for monitoring purposes. Instead it’s primarily used to prevent vessels from colliding at sea.</p>
<p>The use of AIS transceivers, however, is a relatively new approach in the fight against illegal fishing. “I think that AIS has only recently started to be used because it was not designed for fisheries monitoring purposes,” says Brad Soule from Catapult, adding that the number of satellites available for monitoring AIS do make it a useful tool for other maritime domain awareness purposes as long as you “account for some of the security issues that have already been addressed in traditional vessel monitoring systems.”</p>
<p>Collecting the AIS data was only the first step towards building a more accurate picture of the types of activities and behavioral patterns of vessels in Easter Island waters, as it’s the actual correlation and overlaying of data sources which facilitates the identification of vessel types.</p>
<h2><strong>Tracking vessels that don’t want to be tracked</strong></h2>
<p>Despite huge advances in satellite monitoring technology, “it can still be rigged to fool its users, and AIS and VMS are no different,” states Tony Long from Pew. Effective use of vessel tracking systems to detect illegal fishing activities therefore requires an understanding of how vessels circumvent the system in order to go unnoticed. Moreover, it’s vital that users have a thorough understanding of the differing behavior patterns and movements between cargo vessels and fishing vessels when monitoring their tracks on a screen.</p>
<p>Off the coast of Easter Island, SkyTruth collected AIS data that revealed distinct patterns of vessel movement and enabled the detection of suspected illegal activity. For example, vessels that move very slowly and frequently change directions are typically engaged in fishing activities, whereas those moving in straight lines at a steady speed are more likely to be cargo ships moving between South America and Asia.</p>
<p>Vessels that aren’t broadcasting AIS signals could be deliberating switching them off to avoid detection, but Amos says that this lack of signal could also result from gaps in orbiting satellite coverage.</p>
<p>To ensure continued monitoring coverage, SkyTruth regularly collected radar satellite imagery to see if any vessels appeared to be operating in Easter Island waters that were not broadcasting an AIS signal. “In many cases,” says Amos, “we could not find any AIS signals for vessels that appeared on the satellite imagery.”</p>
<p>So who were these vessels?</p>
<p>Amos calls them the <em>dark fleet</em>: vessels that “operate in stealth by not publicly broadcasting their identity.” In other words, vessels likely to be carrying out illegal fishing activities.</p>
<p>“In the remote waters of Easter Island,” Amos says, “we can assume a vessel larger than 20 meters that is not broadcasting AIS is probably a commercial fishing vessel.”</p>

<h2><strong>Keeping one step ahead</strong></h2>
<p>As demonstrated by the Skytruth study—where over half of the vessels monitored did not transmit an AIS signal—illegal fishing vessels are increasingly aware that they are being monitored through their safety and anti-vessel collision transceiver.</p>
<p>Even transceivers which are designed for monitoring purposes, such as the government enforced Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), face the challenge of having the devices tampered with once installed. VMS is not applied universally and the mandatory ping rate varies per country, with most setting it at every 1- 2 hours. Experts recommend a ping rate of multiple times per hour in order to capture 100% of fishing locations.</p>
<p>With illegal fishing operations increasingly becoming aware of how the current traditional monitoring systems can be fooled, how reliable is the data being generated for analysts?</p>
<p>“It’s a good question and an important one,” says Soule from Catapult.</p>
<p>“AIS was never designed for fisheries and marine reserve monitoring. It is only recently that it has become a useful tool by virtue of the growth in the number of fishermen who want to demonstrate transparency and compliance in their operations. But you are right, by itself AIS is not a panacea without an understanding of the vessels’ identities and thereby likely activities in the context of the area of operation and specific jurisdictions.”</p>
<p>Adding information from another transceiver is one way to help build a more accurate picture.</p>
<p>“We also use vessel monitoring system (VMS) data, when it is made available, to monitor the activities of fishing vessels,” says Soule. One of the marked differences between AIS and VMS, is that the latter can be required by governments or vessel owners and do not broadcast positions publicly.</p>
<p>An experienced fisherman from a North African country explained that one way around collecting more accurate VMS data would be for governments to require vessels to have their systems on two weeks before the fishing season begins. This would “allow for better control, ahead of season” and provide a better understanding of that vessel’s behavior patterns.</p>
<p>Beyond the use of positional data relayed by transceivers to monitor specific areas, the addition of a variety of sensors, “including satellite radar and optical imagery” is also a key data component to detect the presence of vessels, explains Soule.</p>
<p>This year, the U.S. government plans to further develop an application to assist in detecting ocean vessels in countries including Indonesia and the Philippines, using the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), another form of space-based sensor. VIIRS is capable of detecting lights—including from boats that use lights to attract fishery catch at night—in order to target potentially illegal activities.</p>
<p>Advances are also being made in the speed at which the merging of data is being processed, which is a huge step forward in providing real time coverage of remote areas, especially when working in tandem with authorities who can deploy patrols to carry out further investigations.</p>
<p>“Previously it took a team of analysts 18 hours or more to analyze the data and be able to find a vessel of interest. This system brings together all of those datasets in less than 18 milliseconds,” explains Nick Wise, head of Catapult’s Ocean Sustainability business unit.</p>
<p>The new system in question is the recently launched Project Eyes on the Sea, a maritime monitoring and surveillance data platform that was developed in partnership with Catapult and the Pew Charitable Trusts.</p>
<div id="attachment_533" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-533" class="size-full wp-image-533" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room.jpg" alt="Catapult operation room (Credit: Jennifer Gillam)" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room.jpg 900w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-533" class="wp-caption-text">Catapult operation room (Credit: Jennifer Gillam)</p></div>
<p>This platform uses and merges multiple sets of data, including Vessel Monitoring Data (government collected data), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, optical imaging as well as AIS, and has been designed to enable enforcement efforts to focus on specific problem areas and vessels, cutting in time and money.</p>
<p>“We consider anything that provides a position, an identity, and some behavioral information—or any combination of these, and bring together many data sources that don’t usually exist in the same system,” explains Soule, adding that the system enables an analyst to “know where to look next.”</p>
<p>In the future, it will be able to merge and incorporate other sources of information third-party surveillance and crowd-sourced images that could originate from any person, ship, aircraft, or unmanned vehicle. Despite recent technological advances in monitoring, the high seas—an area representing two-thirds of the world’s ocean—remain notoriously difficult to monitor and patrol for illegal fishing activities. Less than one percent of the open ocean is accorded protection.</p>
<p>“At the moment, the high seas are the weakest link because of their poor management and lack of governance,” explains Professor Alex Rogers of Somerville College, Oxford.</p>
<h2><strong>Future ocean surveillance: What’s on the horizon? </strong></h2>
<p>Advanced technologies, remote surveillance tools, and satellite monitoring of the high seas have long been accessible to the military, as well as (though to a much lesser degree) governments, fisheries management agencies, and private companies such as international couriers. Since 2013, however, an important shift has taken place towards increasing access to satellite data, and also understanding the gaps in data which allow for illegal vessels to circumvent whatever moderate level of monitoring was taking place to avoid detection.</p>
<p>However, for all the progress made, satellite-based technological advances alone cannot be relied upon to curb illegal fishing or monitor newly protected areas on the high seas.</p>
<p>Nor is space-based monitoring not without its own evolutionary problems, as it “requires significant computational horsepower to bring the data together and compare the different sources to identify abnormalities,” according to Soule.</p>
<p>Satellite-based technological advances greatly reduce the human power needed to process vast quantities of data and are likely to become fully integrated into monitoring platforms ten years from now. As satellite coverage of transceivers expands and more and more governments require vessels to install them, however, they are unlikely to be relied upon alone.</p>
<p>Vessel ID registration is still not mandatory in all regions, which means that unlike traffic offenses on a speed camera, it will take some time before we have a global or even regional database linking a vessel’s ID to a tracking system, although huge progress is being made in national waters.</p>
<p>In the future, illegal fishing practices may also be curbed by the universal and mandatory application of electronically tracking fish at points of catch and sale, a regulation that an increasing amount of regional fisheries organizations are moving towards. In the long run, this is likely to shrink the market for illegal catches.</p>
<p>Today, on-site enforcement action and regular patrols in the air, at sea, and in ports, coupled with prosecution for crimes committed remain vital components in the global fight against illegal fishing.</p>
<p>Twenty years from now, however, if autonomous anti-collision drone technology continues to evolve at the predicted rate, future high-seas satellite monitoring platforms are likely to integrate this aerial surveillance tool not only as a key monitoring feature, but also one that expedites enforcement.</p>
<p>The current reality, however, is that policing remote areas of the open ocean is left in most instances to governments who have neither the means nor the human resources to properly enforce existing regulations in such remote locations. Overcoming such challenges may well require the increased use of satellite and autonomous aerial surveillance technologies &#8212; bridgingthe gap between sea and sky in a very modern way.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we drive down the empty, two-lane highway, the clusters of seaside resorts, tin-roofed homes and finely manicured lawns on this Papua New Guinea island give way to lowland rain forests and palm oil plantations. The telephone lines eventually disappear as do the satellite dishes and, within hours, the team from the Canadian mining company Nautilus Minerals is on a rutted, dirt road.</p>
<p>Beyond the occasional sprawling logging camps on New Ireland, there are few signs the modern world has touched this part of the Asia-Pacific nation that features 600 islands and 800 languages. Largely cut off from the outside world, villagers earn a few dollars each week farming small patches in the forest for sweet potatoes and coconuts and catching the occasional fish with flimsy, dugout canoes. There is no electricity here, no toilets, no phone services, no cars and certainly no Internet. Big black pigs are a sign of status and community life revolves around ancient tribal rituals evoked by the spirit houses in most villages and shark calling, a dying tradition where villagers shake rattles made of seashells to attract sharks to the shores before snatching them up with their hands.</p>

<p>It’s in these two dozen or so villages that hug the coastline along the Bismarck Sea that Canadian-based Nautilus has spent several years pitching a simple message: We can make your lives better if you let us mine the seafloor beginning in 2018.</p>
<p>Villagers support the idea of new sanitation systems, homes and bridges. But they don’t fully comprehend what Nautilus wants to do at a site 30 kilometers (18.64 miles) off the coast out in the Bismarck Sea. Located about 1,600 meters (5,200 feet) down, the site is home to a network of hydrothermal vents and near an undersea volcano, a harsh environment where mineral-rich water as hot as 400 degrees Celsius (750 degrees Fahrenheit) pours through the vents, meeting icy cold water and forming the concentrations of gold, copper and other minerals that are 10 times what is found in traditional mines on land.</p>
<h2><strong>A race to the bottom of the sea</strong></h2>
<p>There is plenty at stake if the company goes ahead with its ambitions plans. Its success has the potential to set off a modern day gold rush to the seafloor, a prospect that troubles deep-sea scientists and environmentalists who fear this could lay waste to some of the world’s most diverse and poorly understood ecosystems.</p>
<p>Because of technological advances, difficulties of mining on land and growing demand for minerals like copper, gold and zinc, scores of nations and multinational conglomerates are rushing to lay claim to huge areas of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans &#8211; some sites the size of small countries.</p>
<p>Supporters see this as a chance to tap the 70 percent of minerals not on land and transform how we source these natural resources so critical to smart phones, computers and other electronic devices. It’s also an opportunity for the industry to shrink its environment footprint, which on land involves displacing villages, fouling rivers with mine waste and lopping off entire mountains to get to the minerals – none of which Nautilus says it will do.</p>

<p>“There are a lot of resources on the seafloor. It’s not inconceivable that ocean mining will be a similar thing in 20 years to what offshore oil and gas is for things like copper, nickel, cobalt and zinc,” said Nautilus CEO Mike Johnson, who spent decades gold mining including in PNG before joining Nautilus in 2006. “We have to treat the planet holistically. We can’t say we are only going to do this stuff on land … We have to look at the impact man has over the entire planet.”</p>
<p>Environmentalists counter that the technology is unproven and that risks to marine life are far too great to allow deep sea mining. Led by a consortium of groups under the Deep Sea Mining Campaign, they are calling for a moratorium until it’s proven safe.</p>
<p>At the same time, scientists fear the mining could destroy hundreds, if not thousands of miles of hydrothermal vents systems, undersea mountains and submarine volcanoes as well as seamounts containing deep sea coral. And in doing so, the world could lose scores of species before they are even described by scientists as well as potential resources for new classes of drugs, cosmetics and fuels.</p>
<p>“If you wipe out large areas of sea floor and cause species extinction, you actually change the future of life on earth, how it evolves if you do it on a large enough scale,” said University of Hawaii’s Craig Smith, a co-author on a paper in <em>Science</em> in July that called for implementing adequate environmental protections for deep sea mining.</p>
<p>“We are doing it on terrestrial environments clearly. So far, we haven’t done it on that scale in the deep sea but there is potential if things aren’t managed,” he added.</p>
<h2><strong>A century-long search</strong></h2>
<p>The idea of scooping up minerals from the sediments of the world’s oceans is not new.</p>
<p>Ever since manganese nodules were first discovered in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century in the Kara Sea during the expedition of the H.M.S. Challenger, geologists have dreamed of tapping riches of gold, silver, zinc, magnesium, iron, cobalt and copper in the deepest parts of the ocean.</p>
<p>One of the earliest attempts to mine them came in the 1970s, when a consortium led by Lockheed Martin spent $500 million mining the nodules miles down in the Clarion Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ). Interest intensified further in 1977 when scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution discovered the first hydrothermal vents in the Galapagos Rift, more than 2,500 meters (8,202 feet) down in the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of South America.</p>
<p>But the sector has struggled since then to gain respect not only from suspicious governments, but the traditional mining industry.</p>
<p>“A lot of people laughed at us,” said Julian Malnic, an Australian exploration geologist who started Nautilus in the 1990s and has been described as the godfather of marine mining.</p>
<p>“One high-profile commentator suggested we were going to use explosives. They don’t even work down there,” he said. “There was a big ignorance factor which everyone was in a hurry to showcase but, in my experience, when you have a new idea, you haven’t got a friend in the world.”</p>
<p>While Anglo-American has a nearly 6 percent stake in Nautilus, none of the other big players have dipped their toes in the water. The sector is mostly dominated by tiny companies with names like Diamond Field International and Neptune Resources that fill their websites with glossy photos and videos of potential sites with a prospector’s air of excitement at the incredible minerals waiting to be mined. However, no one has yet to do it on a commercial scale.</p>
<p>Malnic attributed that to the cautious nature of the mining industry and the boom and bust cycle that comes with the territory. When mineral prices are low, exploration budgets dry up as does financing for riskier projects.</p>
<p>The lack of regulations also prevents mining in international waters. But even in national waters where the projects are far smaller and the sites shallower and more accessible, governments have grown increasingly alarmed.</p>
<p>In the past year, New Zealand’s Environmental Protection Agency has twice rejected applications for deep-sea mining – one for phosphorite used in fertilizer and the other for iron ore sand deposits. Phosphate mining has raised concerns all over the world because it often takes place in vital fishing areas – in New Zealand, it would have overlapped with a critical nursery for hoki.</p>
<p>New Zealand also created one of the world’s largest marine reserves in September, a 620,000 square kilometer area that would ban a number of commercial activities including mineral prospecting and mining. Last year, President Obama protected 400,000 square miles of the central Pacific Ocean, banning commercial fishing, deep sea mining and other forms of resource extraction.</p>
<p>The Northern Territory in Australia, meanwhile, placed a moratorium on exploration and seabed mining off its coast in 2012. A year later, Namibia followed suit with an 18-month moratorium on mining in response to plans to mine the waters for phosphate.</p>
<p>“A lot of people are quite shocked to find out about deep sea mining,” said Helen Rosenbaum of the Deep Sea Mining Campaign, a coalition of anti-mining NGOs from the South Pacific, Australia and Canada, noting that oceans are already under threat from pollution, over fishing and climate change.</p>
<p>“The general public aren’t aware of it,” she said. “This is another way in which our oceans are being hammered. They are already predicted to fail ecologically over the next couple of decades if we continue business as usual with the impacts they are already experiencing &#8211; let alone this new one.”</p>
<h2><strong>One company’s daring experiment</strong></h2>
<p>The companies themselves have had their own challenges, none more so than Nautilus.</p>
<p>Malnic first secured rights to the site off PNG’s New Ireland in 1997 after attending a presentation at Australia’s premier scientific institution, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, on the discovery of seafloor massive sulfides at the bottom of the Bismarck Sea.</p>
<p>So, he did what any good mining prospector does. He reconstructed the seafloor maps and quickly secured exploration licenses in PNG for Solwara 1 and another site in 1997. From there, he started scouring the South Pacific for other sites, recognizing that most were within the 200-mile economic exclusion zone of these island nations.</p>

<p><em>Deep sea mining in Solwara 1 (Courtesy: Nautilus)</em></p>
<p>“Here were these beautiful high grade sulfides coming out of the box,” said Malnic, recalling the lecture when the high-grade ore from the Bismarck Sea was put on display.</p>
<p>“I could see immediately the great potential. From my point of view, there was tonnage and grade and that is what miners need,” he said. “I’m still totally excited. This is the frontier for copper and zinc production in the future.”</p>
<p>The excitement, however, would give way to more than a decade of frustration and delays.</p>
<p>Traditional mining companies wouldn’t touch the project and efforts to raise capital came up against “the second half of a nuclear winter of zero capital available for exploration and mineral projects,” Malnic said. The 1997-98 economic crisis was just beginning.</p>
<p>It would be another five years before the crisis eased and a metals market, driven by the emergence of the resource-hungry Chinese economy, started recovering. Soon enough, the suitors started knocking on Nautilus’ doors, with Anglo-American, the London-based mining company, taking a small stake. An Omani-based oil services firm and a Russian metals company have together taken almost 49 percent stake in the company.</p>
<p>Yet even as the financing began flowing, the company struggled. Malnic left in 2006 and the company went through two more CEOS before settling on Johnson. Its stock, which debuted on the Toronto Stock Exchange, reached a high of $4.38 in 2008 before falling rapidly to 28 cents at the time of publication.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company learned just how hard it can be to operate in a tribal society where minerals like gold and copper are abundant, but so is corruption, angry land owners and activists increasingly fearful about the environmental damage caused by mining.</p>
<p>It didn’t help that the company was arriving on the back of several high profile mining disasters in PNG, including tens of millions tons of waste from the Ok Tedi gold and copper mine that polluted a river on the island of New Guinea that some 50,000 people depend on for water.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rPxEV4puGlE&amp;w=560&amp;h=315" height="315" width="100%"></iframe></p>
<p>“They spent $400 million and didn’t come up with a mine,” said Malnic, of money he claims mostly went to scientific studies and other fieldwork. “It was just catastrophic. They could have been mining twice over for that much and they came away with a bunch of studies and some contracts. It’s unforgivable.”</p>
<p>Nautilus and the PNG government fell out over the government’s failure to contribute its share of developing cost to the project, forcing the dispute into court and almost killing the project. The unstable government – at one point featuring two dueling prime minsters – didn’t help matters.</p>
<p>But last year, the two sides resolved their differences and the government got a stake in the project’s potentially lucrative intellectual property. The settlement has the easy-going Johnson – a New Zealander who often favors a dress shirt and jeans to a suit and throws in the occasional cuss word when making a point – more bullish than he has been in years.</p>
<p>“When we were in the dispute with the government, a lot of people were sitting on sidelines watching,” said Johnson, who has been credited with repairing relations between the two sides. “Now that the dispute is finished, there is a lot of interest again. A lot people want to see us go a little bit further. We are very confident once this first mine is up running, people are going to go, wow, this actually works.”</p>
<h2><strong>A rush to get a piece of the action</strong></h2>
<p>Some of the greatest interest in seabed mining in the past few years has been around the CCZ, an area about 80 percent the size of the contiguous United States in the Pacific between Mexico and Hawaii. But some estimates, it contains an estimated 62 billion tons of nickel, copper and cobalt in bowling ball-sized nuggets littering the seafloor.</p>
<p>Because they are in international waters, the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a tiny U.N.-affiliated body with offices in Jamaica, is tasked with issuing licenses to explore these and other areas. Just in the past four years, the number of exploration license has jumped from 7 in 2006 to 27 &#8211; 18 for polymetallic nodules in the CCZ, five for polymetallic sulfides and four for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts – in an area that encompasses 1.4 million square kilometers.</p>
<p>Increasingly, companies backed by the likes of Russia, Japan and China as well as tiny island nations like Tonga and Kiribati are taking out permits to explore huge sections of the seafloor. One of the biggest private firms, UK Seabed Resources, a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin UK, is prospecting for minerals in a 22,300 square mile area of the CCZ and says that could bring $60 billion to the UK economy over a 30-year period.</p>
<p>“What we have seen in the past few years is a huge explosion in activity,” said Michael W. Lodge, the deputy to the ISA’s Secretary-General and Legal Counsel.</p>
<p>“It shows an increasing interest in the sector and prospects for the sector. There are two or three things converging – developments in technology that makes it more realistic and the cost of traditional mineral projects is becoming more expensive and difficult to source,” he said. “You are reaching a point of equilibrium – although seabed mining is terribly expensive and very high risk – it’s competitive with the cost of setting up a source on land. Also, people are looking for long-term sources of very high grade minerals.”</p>
<h2><strong>More than just minerals in the deep</strong></h2>
<p>The prospect of a mining boom in the deep sea worries scientists like Stace E. Beaulieu, a biological oceanographer at Woods Hole who has spent the past 20 years studying the biodiversity and abundance of life on the ocean’s seafloor. She got onto her first research cruise in 1990, a few years before Nautilus even opened its doors.</p>
<p>Wiry, funny and full of energy, Beaulieu acknowledged she gets an e-mail a week fretting about deep sea mining and the unknowns that come with it.</p>
<p>“Right now, we don’t know what will happen when mining starts,” she said. “We do know the animals living at the sites that are mined will be eradicated but we don’t know whether or how quickly those communities can become reestablished. That uncertainty is why a lot of deep-sea scientists have great concern about mining.”</p>

<p>Like the other scientists in Lauren Mullineaux’s lab at Woods Hole who study the world’s hydrothermal vents and other seafloor habitats, Beaulieu is passionate about the deep sea. If she isn’t gearing up for a weeks-long journey on a research vessel, the avid runner and biker is hunkered down in her tiny, cluttered lab filled with mementos of past trips including nets and foot-long bottles containing red-tipped tube worms and dozens of preserved samples in ethanol. Just down the road from the lab is the tranquil, ocean-side community of Woods Hole, with its lobster shack, organic coffee and a marina that looks out on Vineyard Sound.</p>
<p>But making your life work about a place you can only visit in a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) requires plenty of patience. Beaulieu gets brief glimpses of the seafloor via the cameras on these ROVs and the random samples she manages to pull up in plankton nets. The best is when she can get into a piloted submersible and take a trip to the seafloor, something she has done 14 times including a journey 4,100 meters or about two miles down off the coast of California.</p>
<p>“When you are in the submersible, you experience how remote, how far away the habitat is,” she said, describing a trip that can take upwards of two hours in the pitch-black ocean. “When you use a robot you are on the ship and looking at screen as if you are watching on TV. You don’t have the same feeling.”</p>
<p>One of her favorite dives took place in 2006 on the East Pacific Rise soon after a volcanic eruption. She had a front row see to the communities coming back to life, as the lava flowed forth.</p>
<p>“The surface of the seafloor had changed,” she said. “There were all these small-sized animals like juvenile fish, and tubeworms. I was experiencing the rebirth of a habitat.”</p>
<p>Unlike other scientists who may study the seafloor’s mega fauna like clams, crabs or tubeworms, Beaulieu and her lab mates are more concerned with the macro fauna &#8211; the benthic invertebrate communities including snails, smaller worms and crustaceans. They are among the most diverse animals on the seafloor and play a critical role in the food web.</p>
<p>“We want to find early life stages of animals that live on the sea floor,” she said, holding up a pinky-sized tube containing samples that came from a 2010 trip to the Mariana Arc and the site of an erupting submarine volcano. “Now, they are mostly transparent and white. In life, they have beautiful colors. They are much more beautiful alive.”</p>
<p>When the first hydrothermal vents were discovered in 1977, scientists were shocked with what they saw. Instead of flat featureless desert, they found vents were teaming with tubeworms, mussels, clams, crabs, snails and shrimp.</p>
<p>“The thing that caught everyone’s attention when they first discovered the vents was the large numbers and large volumes and large biomass in the animals and communities,” said Mullineaux, who has been on 30 cruises and made nearly 40 dives as part of her work studying the dispersal of larvae of benthic invertebrates and their return to the sea floor.</p>
<p>“This was a huge surprise because, at that time, we thought deep sea communities were being fed by small particles that drifted down from the sea surface where they were produce by photosynthesis,” she said. “Clearly, that production by photosynthesis was not sufficient to fuel these amazing robust communities that we found on the sea floor.”</p>
<p>As scientists began studying these vent communities, often near volcanically active areas, Mullineaux said they realized something else entirely was happening – a process called chemosynthesis, where microbes – fixing carbon and creating organic carbon and as endosymbionts in tube worms and mussels &#8211; converted chemicals that were dissolved in the vent fluids into usable energy.</p>
<p>“Instead of the fixed carbon coming in from plants at the sea surface, it comes from the microbes at the bottom of the ocean,” she said.</p>
<p>Mullineaux also said scientists became fascinated with “bizarre adaptions” that these creatures were making in environments that were not only toxic, but prone to landslides and volcanic eruptions. One of the strangest is a family of tubeworms called <em>Siboglinidae</em> that have no mouth or gut and “get all their sustenance by these endosymbionic microbes that live inside them.”</p>

<p>Other creatures adapt to the pressure with membrane structures that “allow them to not turn congealed under cold temperature and high pressure,”  according to Cindy Lee Van Dover, another deep sea scientist who is the director of the Duke University Marine Laboratory. Then there is a species of shrimp, she said, whose eyes are withdrawn into its body and has “way more sensory pigment than most organisms” – possibly as a way to see the light from black smoker chimneys.</p>
<p>Hundreds of these vents – considered one of the hot spots for massive sulfides &#8211; have since been found and a thousand are believed to be out there, according to a 2010 study in Marine Policy led by several scientists at Woods Hole. In August, scientists writing in journal Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems announced they had discovered 20 underwater hydrothermal plumes along the Australian-Antarctic Ridge, an underwater mountain range that sits between Tasmania, New Zealand and Antarctica.</p>
<p>As more vents are found, scientists have come to realize these systems are some of the world’s most diverse ecosystems – defined by their topographic differences, tectonic activity and deep ocean circulation patterns. Age is also a factor, with Manus Basin that includes the Nautilus site featuring vents that are thousands of years old while those in the East Pacific Rise, a mid-ocean ridge in the Pacific, are much younger because they are often destroyed by volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>As a result, the composition of the vent communities varies widely. Vents in the Eastern Pacific, for example, are dominated by tubeworms and clams, while those in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge feature shrimp. In the Antarctic, vents host sea anemones and bright yellow, flower-like crinoids.</p>
<p>Scientists are also identifying scores of vent species new to science – 200 so far by one count in vents, seeps and other seafloor environments. The yeti crab, a hairy crustacean with no eyes, was discovered near hydrothermal vents off Easter Island, while a new family of squat lobsters were found living in the vents along the Pacific-Antarctic ridge.</p>
<p>A similar process of discovery is taking place in other ecosystems targeted by the mining industry, especially in the CCZ, whose largely unexplored rolling seafloors have higher diversity than vents, but are mostly dominated by tiny creatures living in the sediment. Smith has spent much of his career in the area, including conducting several environmental baseline surveys for UK Seabed Resources.</p>
<p>“I’m just working on the data now and the samples are some of the most diverse, have some of the highest species diversity of samples ever collected from the sea floor,” Smith said, his voice rising with excitement, noting that each of these quarter square meter samples contain upwards of 60 species of polychaete worms, crustaceans, mollusks and snails.</p>
<p>“These are animals living in the sediment that you don’t normally see,” he said. “Every sample we bring up has dozens of new species. In fact, 80 percent to 90 percent of the animals, the species we bring up are new to science. People get all excited about the discovery of a new species in a terrestrial environment. We are bringing up hundreds of then on every cruise.”</p>
<h2><strong>To mine or not to mine</strong></h2>
<p>When he is not at sea, Smith is part of a group of scientists helping to shape environmental measures being drawn up by ISA. Unlike environmentalists who want an all-out ban, Smith and others are more pragmatic, figuring mining will happen at some point so they might as well help shape where it can and can’t go.</p>
<p>So far, nine marine reserves have been provisionally approved for the CCZ and a collection of scientists are helping shape ISA’s regulatory framework – a requirement before any mining can take place and which is expected to be approved in the next few years. In the <em>Science</em> paper, Smith and several scientists called on ISA to “consider suspending further approval of exploration contracts (and not approve exploitation contracts) until marine protected area (MPA) networks are designed and implemented for each targeted region” which includes the Indian and Atlantic oceans.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think slowing down is an excellent idea,” said Lisa Levin, who is with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and co-founded the Deep Ocean Stewardship Initiative, which among other things advises on the use of resources in the deep ocean. “We should be slowing down and collecting relevant information that is needed to make a decision. In most cases, I don’t think we have it. If a moratorium is a way to slow down, that works.”</p>
<p>What makes drawing up these regulations challenging, Levin said, is that each type of mining would take place in ecosystems that “operate on different time and space scales.”</p>
<p>“Some are small and patchy. Some are heavily disturbed and recovery quickly. Some are vast and processes are very slow. Some animals for hundred or thousands of years and others live for 10 years,” Levin said. “So each system requires a careful look at the dynamics and the composition and the vulnerability of those ecosystems to mining impacts.”</p>
<p>Duke University&#8217;s Van Dover and other scientists have suggested staggering the mining activity in a certain area, as well as limiting mining to inactive vents that could be easier to mine, but also less important environmentally. Companies should also consider setting aside areas within their sites so the mining impacts can be evaluated and relocating species deemed ecologically significant.</p>
<p>But with no past experience to go on, it can be a struggle for scientists to know where to draw the line on where mining can take place and its potential impacts. Nautilus, for example, may be starting with Solwara I, but it has far greater ambitions.</p>
<p>It has more than 500,000 square kilometers (310,686 miles) of exploration acreage in the Western Pacific, including some 19 sites in the Bismarck as well as sites in Tonga, Fiji, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands as well as international waters in the eastern Pacific.</p>
<p>“The cumulative impacts for any of the mining scenario is what is really critical,” Van Dover said. “If Nautilus only mines one site, no big deal. If they mine two sites, we don’t know. Three sites, we don’t know where the tipping is, where does it matter in terms of the connectivity of the animals and when will you lose not just species diversity but ecosystem function and services.”</p>
<p>Short of wiping out the tube worms, bivalves and gastropods living around the Nautilus vents, there also are concerns the project could change the chemistry near the vent sites and produce toxic plumes that could bury organism and clog the feeding apparatus of sea creatures.</p>
<p>“There is no way to know where the plume is going to go until they make it,” said Van Dover, who has in the past studied the Nautilus site. “We haven’t seen the mining tools in action. We don’t know how much sediment they are going to move.”</p>
<h2><strong>Islanders – Guinea pigs or pioneers</strong>?</h2>
<p>Opponents, who for several years have waged a global campaign against the Nautilus project, paint a far grimmer picture. In a series of detailed reports, they warn that storms, spills or technical snafus could spark a disaster that could wipe out fisheries, destroy some of the world’s most diverse coral reefs and pollute the waters of coastal communities across the South Pacific.</p>
<p>“People are afraid because they know there will be damage on our reefs, affecting our marine life,” said David Bekeman, a primary school teacher in Komalu, a village near the mine site. “Nautilus is telling us there will be no damage. We definitely know there will damage but we don’t have the power to stop anyone from doing anything in the sea.”</p>
<p>While Nautilus is building latrines and handing out textbooks, a loose-knit, cash-strapped group of opponents that includes young activists, school teachers, church leaders and a retired army colonel have tried to raise awareness – Nautilus would call it scaring people – in the international community and in some of the impacted villages.</p>

<p>“We aren’t anti-development but we are saying to the government that it must act responsibly,” said William Bartley, a retired colonel who opposed the project. “Papua New Guinea is not ready for this. They have not even told us what actions they would take supposing an environmental disaster does occur.”</p>
<p>Johnson dismisses the criticism from “outside groups” that “don’t want this to happen” and insists his project will only cause harm to the fauna at the mine site. Sounding at times weary and frustrated, he said he has repeatedly gone to villages to tell them that the plumes won’t rise high enough to impact their fisheries.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard a lot of that stuff and a lot of that is misinformation. I’ve heard the one about poisoning the water. I don’t even know where that comes from,” Johnson said. “It makes me quite angry when I see outside NGOs telling villagers that is going to happen because the river is really important to them.”</p>
<p>In these villages of mostly bamboo huts surrounded by idyllic views of the rocky coastline, the villagers are left with competing versions of the future. Will mining activities bring development or destruction to their lands?</p>
<p>For now, much of the action is on building the mining equipment in places like the United States ad United Kingdom that has been adapted from technology already in use in the oil and gas, dredging and coal industries. Once it starts, the plans call for lowering several remote-controlled, robotic cutting machines weighing as much as 310-tons to the seafloor. Mineral-laced rocks will be carved from the seafloor and sent up through riser pipes and lifting systems to a tanker-like ship waiting on the surface. The excess water from the ore will be returned to the sea bottom and the minerals sent to China’s state-owned Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group.</p>
<p>The company plans to hire several dozen Papuans for its three-year project. But with villagers having little education and skills to qualify for the best jobs, the company will likely leave its mark on communities that have long been neglected by a cash-strapped and corrupt government.</p>

<p>But as the company expands its role to include that of a traditional NGO, the tiny Nautilus team appears overwhelmed. They talk of wanting to bring significant change, but they have little experience and the problems they encounter would be a test for the likes of seasoned veterans such as Save the Children or Oxfam International.</p>
<p>The schools are a classic example. They lack textbooks, water and toilets – forcing children to relieve themselves in rivers and exposing girls to sexual harassment and rape. The classrooms have almost nothing beyond a chalkboard and many students must walk hours, if not an entire day, to reach them.</p>
<p>The medical clinics – also hours away by foot – are often shuttered due to a lack of medicine. As a result, some of the most common causes of death in the villages are childbirth as well as treatable diseases like malaria and respiratory ailments, according to Nautilus.</p>
<p>In the villages, there are no shops or businesses, since the rock-strewn dirt mountain roads are often impassable during heavy rains. The only sign of tourism is an abandoned guesthouse built by an Israeli adventurer. Most farmers, meanwhile, have abandoned cash crops like coconuts in favor of staples like yams, since it can be such a challenge to get them to markets.</p>
<p>So, the talk from Nautilus of fighting diseases and easing hunger resonates with villagers like Jenny Gebo, who in her tattered blouse and skirt laments how it takes her all day just to gather enough vegetables to cook the evening meal. Standing over a smoky fire, she was preparing a traditional Papuan meal called <em>mumu</em>, in which the food is soaked in coconut, wrapped in banana leaves and cooked over a pit.</p>
<p>“We are finding it hard now to help our families,” said Gebo, a mother of four from Komalu, one of the closest villages to the mining site. “The mining could help our families. But if the mining comes and the seas get polluted, we won’t get the fresh fish.”</p>

(Credit: Mike Casey)</p></div>
<p>Out in the forest a few miles from the village, Henry Tabu was tending to fires he had lit to clear his land. As the flames reached into the sky and the smoke seared his eyes, Tabu, bare-chested and wearing a cross, recalled how he didn’t earn enough money to send all his five children to school or buy them clothes. He complained that the tiny plot barely was enough to feed his family, as he tossed another tree branch on a growing fire.</p>
<p>He, too, worried about the environmental impact, but saw few alternatives.</p>
<p>“We are trying our best to look after our family,” Tabu said, as his children stoked the fire and a puppy whined in the background. “The project will come. It will help in some ways to make people live better. Maybe it will help me look after my family.”</p>
