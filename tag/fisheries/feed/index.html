								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a Chinese restaurant in a Las Vegas strip mall, Austin Ayer tries to act nonchalant as he orders the most controversial item on the menu.</p>
<p>“Do you want crab in your shark fin soup?” asks the waiter. “It tastes much better.”</p>
<p>“No, just shark fin,” says Ayer. “And I’d like it to go.”</p>
<p>The waiter takes measure of the strapping university student, who, with his blue eyes and rosy cheeks, perhaps doesn’t fit the description of a typical shark fin soup customer. The waiter shrugs: “That’ll be $21.57.” Ayer hands over a credit card. He slowly exhales at the ringing of the cash register.</p>
<p>Minutes later in the parking lot, Ayer opens the pint-sized styrofoam container and pours some soup onto a tray in his makeshift mobile genetics laboratory: the back of his Scion hatchback. He quickly gets to work before his shark fin samples are compromised. “I need to get this out of the hot broth and onto ice as soon as possible,” he says.</p>
<p>Fishing around with long metal forceps, he pulls out chunks of meat. “This looks like crab,” he says. “That’s not what we want.” He sets it aside and teases long, elastic, translucent noodle-like strips from the broth: they look like the tendons that give shark fins their strength. “This is looking better. Here we go.”</p>

(Credit: Kenneth R. Weiss)</p></div>
<p>He washes a few of the filaments with a squirt of distilled water and tucks them in a test tube with an enzyme solution for later genetic tests. If all goes well, the telltale DNA inside the stringy bits will reveal whether the soup contained shark species banned under international law.</p>
<p>Genetic identification has become faster, cheaper, and more reliable in recent years, with advances coming so quickly that even enterprising undergraduates like Ayer can now fashion themselves as DNA detectives. In the not-too-distant future, next-generation sequencing—which allows machines to read millions of gene sequences in one batch—and the promise of a rapid or instant DNA test will transform much of what we know about life in the sea and how fast we can know it.</p>
<p>Combined, these quantum jumps in technology will provide exacting ways to measure if the seafood supply is safe and honest, offer biologists new methods to track elusive endangered species, and empower regulators with instant forensic evidence to crack down on illegal wildlife trafficking or determine the species of fish caught in nets far from shore. And if breakthroughs continue apace, consumers will soon be able to deputize themselves as genetic gumshoes, testing the halibut on their plate to quickly determine if it really is halibut, no matter if it has been filleted, frozen, or fried.</p>
<p>At the center of this revolution is an ID system that uses a snippet of DNA sequence data that belongs to a particular species, with the ambition to build a digital catalogue that includes every species on Earth. These distinct sequences, named DNA barcodes after the familiar black and white stripes on products scanned at the supermarket, are stored on centralized databases. When researchers isolate the right DNA sequence from a new tissue sample, it can be compared to all identified species on file to see if it’s a match. So far, more than 11,000 fish have been ID’d and catalogued within the <a href="http://www.fishbol.org">Fish Barcode of Life</a> computerized repository. It’s part of a larger effort, the <a href="http://www.ibol.org/">International Barcode of Life</a> (iBOL), which has analyzed close to five million samples representing more than 525,000 different species on land and at sea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the race is on to provide a rapid DNA test that Paul Hebert, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Guelph in Ontario and scientific director of iBOL, likens to the handheld “tricorder” used on Star Trek to boldly scan and identify life forms throughout the sci-fi universe. “That’s the world we are heading to,” he says, “reading all forms of life like people read thermometers.” Having this futuristic handheld technology would shorten the time from sample to positive species ID, a system that now requires samples to be sent to a lab for processing and DNA sequencing before they can be compared to a database such as the Fish Barcode of Life.</p>

<p>In a reflective moment, Hebert acknowledges that Spock’s tricorder might not be a perfect comparison because it doesn’t require a tissue sample or even skin contact. “From that standpoint, it’s wrong technically,” he says. “You don’t have that much DNA floating in the air.”</p>
<p>That’s not a problem in the oceans. Fish and other marine creatures regularly slough cells in seawater, leaving telltale environmental DNA (eDNA) in the area that can be read through next-generation sequencing. By processing some water samples, Hebert says, the new technology can “read all of the species that have been in that water that day.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, for example, researchers released the results of the four-year seafaring Tara Expedition, which collected eDNA instead of museum specimens to glean new insights into the interactions of millions of species of plankton, from viruses to microscopic animals.</p>
<p>What’s remarkable is that until the 1970s, scientists didn’t know most of these microbes existed in ocean waters because they couldn’t see them, says Stephen R. Palumbi, a marine biologist at Stanford University<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>“Next-generation sequencing is one of the most astounding breakthroughs in biology in the past 20 or 30 years,” says Palumbi, adding that its potential is just beginning to emerge. Federal government researchers are using it to track elusive porpoises in Alaska and determine if rare spring-run Chinook salmon are making it into the headwaters of the Columbia River. Some scientists are collecting eDNA from ocean water to assess every species that lives in a marine reserve. Others are experimenting with paring eDNA, which identifies which fish are present, with acoustic data from fish-finding sonar to estimate their abundance. Such experiments seek a non-lethal way to survey fish populations, rather than traditional method of catching fish in a trawl net and counting them when they are dead.</p>
<p>It’s possible that one day soon, a fisheries manager who wants to check on commercial catch could rinse a fisherman’s net and scan the rinse water for a genetic signature of every kind of fish that had been caught. That’s on Palumbi’s long to-do list. “Extracting the data is easy,” he says. The hard part, he adds, is finding a commercial fisherman who will allow an outsider to wash his nets for genetic scrutiny.</p>
<p>Palumbi, who is also director of Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California, has been a pioneer in using genetics in marine biology, including taking the lab on the road. He and colleagues repeatedly set up a surreptitious DNA laboratory in a Tokyo hotel room throughout the 1990s that revealed how Japan’s whalers were violating international law by hunting and selling the meat of humpback, blue, gray, fin, and other great whales—far beyond their limited permit to take minke whales for “scientific research.”</p>

<p>Initially, their methodology and findings were denounced by the whaling industry, yet Japan’s government soon cracked down on contraband and mislabeled meat.</p>
<p>“When we started testing whale meat, the process was tedious and laborious,” Palumbi says. “All that is changing with the new technology. It’s easier, cheaper, and more reliable. A high school freshman could do it, if we showed her how.” But could he teach a journalist to do it?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My stint as a temporary lab tech began two months before I went shark fin shopping in Las Vegas with Ayer. I’m driving north toward Pacific Grove when my phone chirps with a text from Palumbi: “Don’t forget your homework.” It’s late and the sushi bars will be closing soon, thwarting my assignment to deliver fresh sushi for sequencing the next morning. A Japanese restaurant beckons from alongside the highway and I find myself sitting at a sushi bar directly beneath the stern gaze of a muscular sushi chef.</p>
<p>Palumbi has his students test their sushi as a primer to DNA sequencing. He says it’s remarkable how often salmon turns out to be trout, flounder gets sold as sand dab, various white fish are billed as cod, and red snapper, or even halibut, is switched out for cheaper farmed tilapia. Restaurants, especially sushi bars, are apparently the worst offenders. Palumbi’s instructions? Bring at least six different types of fish to the lab, and keep them fresh.</p>

(Credit: Kenneth R. Weiss)</p></div>
<p>I order the biggest sashimi platter on the menu, a colorful display of 24 slices of six kinds of fish, asking the chef to point out the various pieces on the plate. He rattles off the names so fast, it’s hard to keep track. As a self-styled sushi sleuth, I need to maintain chain of custody for each sample, getting the assigned names, so I can verify species by their genes. It’s impossible to catch the eye of the busy chef to pose a question, so I wave the menu and begin ordering side dishes. Each time he hands me a new plate, I hold up another piece of sashimi, asking, “What is this?” Soon he’s grumbling in Japanese. When I’m sure I’ve almost worn out my welcome, I give him a big smile and ask for a to-go container. He thrusts a styrofoam box at me without a word. I organize my catalogued specimens in the box, then push my luck and ask for a plastic bag filled with ice. He ignores my question and instead calls out to one of the servers, and, pointing to me, yells, “Check!”</p>
<p>The next morning, the Palumbi Lab emerges from the fog in the heart of the Hopkins Marine Station, which is perched on a rocky point overlooking the churning Pacific Ocean next to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The lab is already full of busy students by the time I arrive at 8:30 a.m. with my samples on ice.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day, I follow Palumbi’s tedious 19-step recipe for preparing tissues for DNA sequencing. It begins with tugging on purple gloves, and using sterile needles to dig out a tiny piece of fish flesh—smaller than a grain of rice—and easing it to a test tube filled with solution. It’s delicate work and, after a half-dozen of these sushi surgeries, I stick myself with a sharp needle and bleed all over the lab.</p>
<p>Aside from helping me staunch the bleeding, Palumbi is a hands-off instructor. First, I dose the samples with the enzyme proteinase K to chemically chew up the tissue and release the DNA. Then, I follow more than a dozen more steps before I load the tubes—now filled with clear liquid—into a sophisticated apparatus the size of a home bread machine where they’re “baked” with the chemical instructions to make thousands of copies of the tiny piece of DNA for easier identification.</p>
<p>All this has to happen before I can send my samples for sequencing. The results come back a few days later via email: each sample translated into a long string of the letters A, T, C, and G—abbreviations for the nucleotide bases that are the building blocks of DNA—each sequence between 570 and 650 characters long. It looks like a child has maniacally typed the letters in random fashion over and over. One by one, I cut and paste the results and enter them into the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) on the National Institute of Health website, to see what I had actually eaten. It takes only seconds to compare the sequences to all of the DNA data collected around the world.</p>

<p>The salmon checks out, as do most of the other pieces. Then I load up the sequence for the ono, also known as wahoo by sports fishermen who revere this bigtasty fish, and send it to BLAST. Six seconds later, I have my answer. It isn’t ono, but a snake mackerel called escolar that has earned the nickname “Ex-lax fish.” Italy and Japan have banned escolar because it contains gempylotoxin, an indigestible wax that can bring on violent cramping and orange diarrhea.</p>
<p>Escolar is often sold as white tuna or by other names in sushi bars, according to conservation organization Oceana’s genetic testing in 2013, which showed a third of seafood was mislabeled in American restaurants and markets. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not banned escolar, but advises against its sale. The FDA got more involved in seafood mislabeling in 2007, when toxic pufferfish from China was sold as monkfish, sickening people and sending at least one to hospital. Since then, it has installed DNA sequencing machines in nine regional laboratories, and set up its own DNA library of the 700 or so most commonly eaten fish—with each barcode tagged to a species identified by expert taxonomists. Rigorous chain of custody is required so federal investigators can prosecute fraudulent mislabeling with DNA evidence that will stand up in court.</p>
<p>Bait-and-switch tactics, such as substituting cheap Vietnamese farmed swai, similar to catfish, for more expensive “red snapper,” remains common among imports that now make up more than 90 percent of US seafood consumption. Federal inspectors struggle to keep up with the flow of fish, much of it arriving after being processed at sea and hard to visually identify. The DNA analysis helps, but the process can be slow and cumbersome as inspectors collect samples, bring them to regional labs and then wait—for days or longer—for the results.</p>

<p>“I would love to see a portable sequencer and rapid extractors,” says Jonathan R. Deeds, principal investigator of the FDA’s genetics project to combat fish fraud. In the meantime, the FDA has experimented with the University of Guelph’s <a href="//itunes.apple.com/us/app/lifescanner-fda-edition/id950330936?mt=8">Lifescanner App</a>, which could quickly transmit test results from inspectors carrying tablets or smartphones to regional labs and FDA headquarters once such rapid DNA tests become reality.</p>
<p>Government and private industry are racing to further technologies that will ultimately help to positively identify fish and other species by their genes on the spot. The US Army’s biosecurity labs at Fort Detrick in Maryland, for instance, are researching methods to instantly identify anthrax and other pathogens. And commercial biomedical research firms are working on the technology, hoping to cash in on quick diagnosis for common bacteria and viruses that plague human patients. There’s even an early version of a handheld unit, developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies in England.</p>
<p>A cottage industry has emerged, with genetic testing companies offering to help restaurants, fish mongers, and seafood distributors clean up their supply chain to avoid running afoul of the law or facing hefty fines. And some researchers are identifying more elaborate genetic markers that go beyond ID’ing the species to differentiate among various populations so scientists can determine where the fish are caught. A consortium of European researchers uses genetics to trace the geographic origin of cod, for instance, whether it’s caught legally or plundered from overfished waters.</p>
<p>Kathy Moore, forensic biologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Charleston, South Carolina, expects that eventually it will become cost-effective to identify genetic profiles for an individual high-priced fish, such as a big blue fin tuna—essentially having a DNA tag that will follow the fish from the boat to the plate. Moore, who works with a <a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ia/iuu/taskforce.html">presidential task force</a> to combat illegal fishing and seafood fraud, has spent decades helping prosecute sea turtle poaching cases, sometimes relying on little more than swabs of turtle blood off baseball bats, knives, and spears that were matched against NOAA’s own curated DNA database of protected species.</p>
<p>All these genetic tests are complex variations of what I am doing in the Palumbi Lab. During my day there, I work alongside Austin Ayer, who is diving into his shark fin science project. While I process my sushi dinner leftovers, he snips and prepares tiny pieces from fins left in the lab’s freezer from when Palumbi used to send his students to Chinatown in San Francisco to purchase shark parts for DNA identification. That was before California banned their sale in 2013, a reaction to the barbaric practice of cutting off a shark’s fins and throwing the writhing animal overboard to bleed to death. Shark populations have plummeted around the world, in large part to meet the demand for shark fin soup, a luxury dish in Chinese culture that has become a symbol of status and wealth.</p>
<p>Inspired by Palumbi’s success in shaking up the Japanese whaling industry, Ayer wanted to do something similar, but only had a summer to tackle a project for his senior honors thesis and still graduate on time. So he settled on trying to replicate the pioneering methods of a <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114844">study</a> published in February 2015 that showed that even in places where shark fin soup is legal, it often contains fins from sharks that are illegally traded. The study found fins of two types of hammerheads in soup purchased in the United States, and managed to identify seven out of eight types of endangered sharks—including whale sharks, basking sharks, and great whites—that are illegal to ship across borders without a permit.</p>

<p>Palumbi approved Ayer’s project. Yet one hurdle remained. When California banned possession of shark fins, getting samples was no longer a convenient matter. So to find the closest place that has a concentration of restaurants with customers willing to shell out handsomely for a high-priced status symbol in a small bowl, Ayer needs to cross state lines.</p>
<p>“I never thought I’d be going to Las Vegas,” he says, “to do field research in marine biology.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before Ayer picks me up along the eight-hour drive to Sin City, he calls every Chinese restaurant in Vegas he can find that reputedly sells shark fin soup. Few show shark fin soup on their online menus, yet, in reality, most of them offer it. Quietly. To those who ask. Prices range from US $20 to $300 a bowl. But would they sell it to him?</p>
<p>Ayer asks Palumbi for guidance, given that his professor has experience buying strange things from the sea for genetic analysis. “It won’t be the weirdest thing that happens in Las Vegas that night,” Palumbi advises him. He suggests that Ayer simply use his chopsticks at the table to pull out shark fin filaments and put them in test tubes. Ayer has another plan: “Ideally, we get as many orders to go as we can.”</p>
<p>The first test comes in the Chinese restaurant in the Vegas strip mall. It’s 37 °C and Ayer opens the restaurant’s double glass doors to a blast of air conditioning. The restaurant is nearly empty. “We are about to find out if this is going to work,” Ayer says under his breath.</p>
<p>After making a successful buy and processing the samples in the sunbaked parking lot, Ayer repeats the routine at another local establishment in Las Vegas’s Chinatown. Then he is ready to hit the Strip. Ayer calculates that his research grant will cover 11 soup samples, provided he limits himself to mid-range prices, nothing more than $70 a bowl. It’s time to go to a high-end joint where discriminating customers would insist that shark fin is the real deal.</p>

<p>Oversized chandeliers, obsequious waiters, and white tablecloths greet our arrival at Jasmine, the Chinese restaurant inside the Bellagio hotel and casino. Plush curtains and valances frame the window overlooking the lighted fountains that dance in the desert night to synchronized music. Shark fin is nowhere on the pricy menu. Ayer orders spring rolls to buy a little time.</p>
<p>When a waitress comes by, Ayer learns the restaurant offers three versions of the soup: the basic, for $60, and the deluxe with a two-ounce clump of shark fin tendons for $150, or a three-ounce clump for $180. Not a high roller, Ayer orders the basic</p>
<p>As soon as it arrives, Ayer receives a text from a friend who needs a pickup at the airport. He snags the server and asks for a to-go cup. The soup is whisked away and returned in a fancy white cardboard box with Bellagio’s looping serif logo. Within minutes, he’s processing the sample in the back of the Scion in the Bellagio’s stifling hot covered parking lot, breathing fumes of the trapped auto exhaust.</p>
<p>We’ve picked up Ayer’s friend and it’s getting late, but Ayer is hoping for one more sample. The Beijing Noodle No. 9 at Caesars Palace is just across the street. It’s almost closing time and the hostess does not want to seat us, but then a gregarious server wearing black-rimmed attitude glasses allows us inside, asking us to order quickly before the kitchen shuts down. He recommends the Singapore noodles and General Tso’s chicken. We accept, but Ayer also asks for shark fin soup. It isn’t on the menu, but the waiter confirms it’s available—a small bowl for $99 and a bowl with a fin for $199—but he has some advice: “Skip it. It’s not worth it. If you asked for it, I don’t think I’d sell it to you. They cut off the fin and let the shark die. It’s so mean.” Ayer skips it. The price is way out of his range.</p>
<p>We close down the Beijing Noodle, head to the Strip for a midnight beer, and then crash for the night at a budget motel. The next morning, we part ways and Ayer spends that day and evening collecting more soup and samples before making the long drive back to the Pacific Grove lab, two ice-packed coolers with his carefully preserved samples in the hatch.</p>

<p>In this forensic work, obtaining and preserving samples with intact DNA is critical: DNA degrades as tissues break down, shattering the long strands into smaller and smaller pieces until they are too short and fragmented to be useful. The challenge facing researchers scrutinizing shark fins is to find a short strand that will survive all of the insults—drying, bleaching, boiling in soup—but one that’s long enough so that they have the information needed to identify a specific species. By Monday morning, Ayer is struggling with the initial round of results from his Las Vegas samples, picking up DNA from other ingredients added for flavor. “There’s tons of DNA in the soup,” he tells me, “[but] half the time, it comes back as pig, or chicken, or crab, or shrimp.”</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, Ayer keeps working on the samples—extracting the DNA and sending it off for sequencing. The results? He was able to isolate enough genetic information to identify the species of shark from every soup he purchased. But one DNA barcode stood out from the rest. It came from a scalloped hammerhead, a warm-water shark so endangered that it has joined the list of species illegal to trade internationally. The discovery left him with mixed feelings of sadness and excitement. “It’s a double-edged sword,” Ayer says. “It’s a bummer to find endangered species. But it makes my project more compelling, a more interesting story to tell.”</p>
<p>The global demand for shark fin soup is driving scalloped hammerheads toward extinction. This shark, with its bizarre head shaped like a sci-fi spaceship, is targeted because its large fins are loaded with ropy strands of collagen that are prized by consumers. The restaurant probably had no idea it was serving the fin of an endangered shark. The distributor was also likely unaware, as were perhaps others in the supply chain that passed through Hong Kong, a hub of the global trade. Short of a global ban on shark fin soup, how can the sharks most threatened with extinction be saved? And can genetics play a role in the solution?</p>
<p>Palumbi considers genetics an insightful tool that can penetrate the most opaque aspects of the seafood market, whether properly identifying whale meat in a Tokyo display case, a box of fish fillets arriving on the docks in Los Angeles, or a fin swimming in a bowl of soup in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before we were blind,” Palumbi says, “but now we can see: DNA technology gives us a vision of what’s in that bowl of soup. Sometimes we find out bad things, but that makes us double down to fix those problems. It’s not just a bowl of soup, but a bowl with strands from an endangered species swirling around. And once we find that out, we can do something about it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Will there be a day when the seafood on your plate has been certified as sustainable, toxin-free and exploitation-free and has been tracked from the time it was hooked to the time it is purchased? Will this information be verified by satellites from the sky that have cross-referenced errant transmissions and have correlated them with reports from an at-sea observer? Will every flag-state inspect the fishing vessels under their jurisdiction for compliance with international regulations to prove clean ownership, transparent operations and vessel seaworthiness? Will conservation, followed by technology and innovation be the prime motivators within the fishing industry thereby reducing wastage and promoting conservation?</p>
<p>Today we are a long way from being able to answer even one of these questions in the affirmative, exposing the vast divide between the principles of the conventions being ratified at the United Nations and the practicality in achieving their goals. Why it is so hard – if not impossible – to achieve a positive response to all those questions? The case of one particular fishing vessel provides some clues.</p>
<div id="attachment_542" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/seashepherd.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-542" class="size-full wp-image-542" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/seashepherd.jpg" alt="The Atlas Cove, Bob Barker and Sam Simon, in pursuit of the poaching vessel, Thunder.

<p>Fishing in the Southern Ocean is regulated by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), one of the seventeen Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) that regulate fishing in various ocean regions across the world. In short, the RFMO consists of interested member countries that flag and operate vessels that fish under the conditions of RFMO permits and report back to ensure a complete feedback system is in place.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, a global market began to develop for Chilean Seabass and there was a rush to fish the rich waters of the Southern Ocean. By the mid-1990s, the illegal catch of Chilean Seabass outweighed those caught legally under CCAMLR, or under national jurisdiction. Strict actions were quickly taken under the CCAMLR to stamp out a bulk of the unsanctioned activity, but six vessels took advantage of legal loopholes and continued to illegally fish inside the controlled waters of the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>The <em>Thunder</em> was one such vessel. She had largely employed some, or all, of the measures listed below to remain beyond the full reach of the current law:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using Flags of Non Compliance: Flagging ships to non-member countries and thereby attaining the status of “Unregulated.” The <em>Thunder</em> flew the flags of Togo, Mongolia, Seychelles, Belize and Nigeria, none of them members of the CCAMLR.</li>
<li>Fishing in the high seas: Fishing in regions where no internationally binding laws apply and therefore acting outside the enforcement regime of the RFMO member-countries. Between 2006 and 2014, the <em>Thunder</em> was sighted a total of eighteen times. She was either fishing in or transiting through the high seas region of the CCAMLR management region.</li>
<li>Calling ports with relaxed enforcement regimes: Landing catch at ports with very relaxed port state controls in South East Asia and Africa, thus ensuring that the vessels are not inspected when landing their catch, while at the same time accessing port facilities to refuel, re-stock and change crew. The <em>Thunder </em>called ports in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Mauritius over the years. She was inspected in Malaysia in 2013 and was found to have on board a cargo of illegally caught Patagonian toothfish. The captain and crew of the <em>Thunder</em> were fined $AU90,000 &#8211; only a fraction of the $US60 million that Interpol estimated that ship’s owners have earned from the vessel’s illegal catch since 2006. Having paid the fine, the crew and ship were later released along with their illegal catch, and they subsequently returned to the Southern Ocean.</li>
<li>Employing additional techniques: Using the invisibility in the oceans to hide the true identity of the vessel by forging documents, hopping flags, changing names and operating under shell companies thereby hiding beneficial ownership. The <em>Thunder</em> swapped names between <em>Rubin, Typhoon I, Kuko, Wuhan No. 4, Ming No. 5</em><em>, </em>and over the years changed ownership at least seven times.</li>
</ol>

<p>Today the <em>Thunder</em> does not exist. She was found fishing illegally within the high seas of the Southern Ocean on December 17, 2014 by the marine conservation group, Sea Shepherd. Operating under the UN World Charter for Nature, Sea Shepherd is well known for its direct-action approach to conservation. With the mandate to uphold international conservation law, Sea Shepherd intervenes to stop environmental crimes that impact the marine environment, in situations where those responsible for law enforcement are unable to, or refuse to, uphold those laws.</p>
<p>Over the next 109 days, the <em>Thunder</em> remained on the high seas, traveling a distance of 10,000 nautical miles from the Southern Ocean to the Indian Ocean and round the Cape of Good Hope to the South Atlantic Ocean, effectively remaining outside the reach of the world’s navies. She moved freely despite being subject to a Purple Notice by Interpol and a reputation for being the world’s most notorious poacher. In early April 2015, the vessel was deliberately sunk by her captain in the waters of São Tomé and Príncipe, a tiny West African island country.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SQ71Y_g116A" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p><em>The</em> <em>Thunder</em> case study presents three distinct facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Illegal vessels do not hide behind a shroud of secrecy. In fact they exist because they remain beyond the full reach of the law.</li>
<li>The illegality within the fishing industry exists because of the maze of countries involved, most often with outdated legal instruments to keep pace with the current industry and a non-harmonization of regulations.</li>
<li>A woeful lack of enforcement and in proactive patrols exists on the world’s oceans. During a recent address in Chile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry sighted the case of the <em>Thunder</em> and commented that, “there are millions of square miles of oceans that are unregulated and that you have unscrupulous people who are chasing the money.” He further added, “The responsibility of pursuing pirate ships cannot be left to environmental groups,” highlighting a need for consensus on greater enforcement mechanisms.</li>

<p>The <em>Thunder</em> case study highlights the importance of at-sea patrols. To achieve true marine conservation, the world needs an ocean governed by laws that can be monitored and enforced. Until lofty principles can be practicably enforced and the questions posed at the beginning of this article be affirmatively answered, on-the-scene enforcement, which stops crimes as they are taking place, remains the most effective tool to target illegal activity on the world’s oceans. And while regulatory grey areas, a lack of resources, and a lack of government will continue to plague maritime law, leading to ineffective enforcement on the high seas, organisations such as Sea Shepherd will continue to play a vital role filling this law enforcement gap.</p>
<p>Consequences for non-compliance must be swift and binding, as it is not the scale of the punishment, but the certainty of it that acts as the biggest deterrent to crime. Currently, the vastness of the high seas and overlaps and gaps between regional and international jurisdictional responsibilities remain a challenge to marine law enforcement. However, recent moves towards international cooperation on fisheries crimes indicate that momentum is building to tackle the challenges, head-on.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Easter Island is best known for its mysterious Moai statues, which dominate part of the hilly coastline and stare at the horizon like ancient watchmen of the once bountiful ocean. Just beyond the reach of their gaze lies a large stretch of open water, known as the high seas, that provides a vital spawning ground for many overfished and highly migratory species, including tuna and sharks.</p>
<p>The seas were once plentiful, notes Alberto Hotus, president of the Easter Island Elder’s Council, who fondly remembers when a fishing boat could easily bring back enough to feed the whole island. “[This] does not happen anymore,” he says with a hint of sadness. “There are no tuna, no fish.”</p>
<p>Residents of the island, also known as Rapa Nui, have long claimed that vessels are fishing illegally in their waters. Many local fishermen attest to seeing the distant glimmer of foreign vessel lights at night.</p>
<p>“People on the island have been complaining about illegal fishing for years,” says Marta Hotus, the governor of Easter Island. Evidence of these activities, such as buoys and long nets—fishing gear that is not used by the locals—even regularly washed ashore.</p>
<p>The Rapa Nui people once used their celestial-based navigation skills to “conquer the islands by navigating across the seas,” says Mayor Pedro Pablo Edmunds Paoa. He describes them as the “Phoenicians of the Pacific,” referring to the ancient Mediterranean civilization renown for having mastered deep-sea navigation, covering great distances in their ships of trade and war.</p>

<p>But the illustrious navigational past of the Rapa Nui alone is no match for the industrial scale of illegal fishing operations. Nor can it reverse the impact on the livelihoods of a community whose very survival has long been tied to the ocean’s bounty.</p>
<p>“What I see in the sea makes me sad because I see fishermen go out and come back with nothing,” says Sara Roe, president of the Hanga Piko fishing association on Easter Island. “Coming back with nothing means that they won’t have bread for their kids, there will be no food for the household, so that is a problem for the people.”</p>
<p>The case of Easter Island partly demonstrates the difficulties faced by governments in monitoring remote areas of the high seas, which in turn become fertile ground for illegal fishing operations. Governments around the world have recognized the scale of the problem and are seeking solutions, but their resources vary enormously.</p>
<p>What role can advances in technology play in putting an end to illegal activities on the high seas that pillage an estimated $23.5 billion worth of fish each year? Because, let’s face it &#8211; trying to look for illegal fishing activities taking place across an area covering half the planet is akin to looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>The answer, some companies say, is by monitoring the seas from the sky.</p>
<p>Stuart Martin, CEO of the U.K.-based firm Satellite Applications Catapult, says that satellite data is now playing a “key role” in helping to end illegal fishing activities. It’s also helping to make the protection of livelihoods in many villages a “reality rather than an idealistic goal.”</p>
<p>John Amos, president of the U.S. non-profit group SkyTruth, agrees. Satellite data and real-time vessel tracking, he says, is “evolving quickly” and “shining a light on the commercial fleet that has been operating largely out of sight since humans first sailed over the horizon.&#8221;</p>

<h2><strong>Out of sight, out of mind </strong></h2>
<p>Located some 4,000 kilometers (2,300 miles) west of Chile, Easter Island’s isolated location coupled with the vast size of its surrounding ocean makes it vulnerable to illegal fishing—a criminal activity taking place on a global scale, fueled in part by the assumption that no one is watching. With the advent of more affordable space-based satellite technologies and their pioneering integration into custom monitoring platforms, there are more eyes than ever on the sea.</p>
<p>“The big change in the last few years that will accelerate into the future is the reduced costs of launching and developing highly effective satellites. As the number and usefulness of satellites increases, more data is available for effective monitoring,” explains Brad Soule, Senior Fisheries Analyst at Catapult’s Ocean Sustainability Business Unit.</p>
<p>As the Rapa Nui community became increasingly concerned with threats to their ocean environment, so did conservation groups, who sought an innovative way to answer their call for greater protection. SkyTruth, an organization that specializes in satellite-based remote sensing technologies, was soon enlisted by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Bertarelli Foundation to monitor and identify the best ways to protect the island’s waters.</p>
<p>The information compiled as part of the project prompted the Chilean Navy to increase its patrol efforts of the province. Likewise, in late 2015, the findings contributed to the announcement of a 631,368 square kilometers (243,630 square miles) marine park around the area, now considered to be the third-largest fully protected area of ocean in the world.</p>
<p>“In early 2012, Pew contacted us to ask if it was possible to monitor the activity of ships – including fishing vessels – in the waters of Easter Island Province,” said John Amos, an expert in using satellite images, aerial photographs and other kinds of remote sensing and digital mapping.</p>
<p>He had founded SkyTruth in 2001.</p>
<p>In January 2013, they began a monitoring program that used satellite radar images to detect the presence of ships, and satellite-collected Automatic Identification System (AIS) broadcasts to identify those vessels. At the time, this was the first instance of these two different technologies being combined in this way to monitor a country’s waters for illegal fishing activity.</p>

<p>Data collected between January and October 2013, including 163 satellite images, detected 73 vessels in and around Easter Island’s waters. Of these, 31 were identified using AIS (to include 22 cargo ships, 5 fishing vessels, 1 cruise ship, and 3 undefined). More than half (the remaining 42 vessels) could not be identified using their AIS broadcasts, but based on their size and location were determined by SkyTruth to be commercial fishing vessels. More than half of those vessels (a total of 25) were detected within Easter Island’s Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>
<h2><strong>Knowing where to look</strong></h2>
<p>“To stop illegal fishing and other crimes taking place on the ocean, authorities first need to be able to recognize and track vessels,” argues Pew’s Tony Long in his article “Satellite Tracking Can Unmask Illegal Fishing Vessels.” The former British naval commander now directs the organization’s <em>Ending Illegal Fishing Project.</em></p>
<p>Unlike mobile phones or cars, fishing vessels are not required to have an identification number. This means that identifying vessels at sea is not a straightforward exercise and requires the integration of differing but complimentary tools into a monitoring platform.</p>
<p>So how does it work?</p>
<p>The monitoring project conducted off Easter Island, for example, pioneered the combined use of two key tools—radar imagery and the Automatic Identification System (AIS)—to track and identify vessels.</p>
<p>Radar satellites can identify ships by beaming microwave (radar) energy down at the Earth’s surface and collecting the energy that is reflected back toward the satellite. According to SkyTruth’s Amos, steel-hulled ships are “strong reflectors of microwave energy and appear as very bright targets or radar images of the ocean.”</p>
<p>This allows for the observation of vessel activities without their participation or knowledge, an especially vital tool for ships that deliberately switch off their transceivers in order to avoid detection or don’t have them installed.</p>
<p>These radar images can yield basic information, including the exact location of a vessel at the moment the image was acquired, its approximate size and in some cases, the direction it’s moving. “But there is little information in a radar image that allows us to identify the vessel, or determine if it’s a fishing vessel rather than a cargo ship or other type of ship,” says Amos.</p>

<p>To fill the gap, SkyTruth combined radar satellite imagery with a second monitoring component known as a satellite-collected Automatic Identification System (AIS)—a form of automatic transceiver similar to a global positioning system (GPS) that is broadcast by vessels. Unlike other transceivers, such as the government-controlled Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), AIS was not designed for monitoring purposes. Instead it’s primarily used to prevent vessels from colliding at sea.</p>
<p>The use of AIS transceivers, however, is a relatively new approach in the fight against illegal fishing. “I think that AIS has only recently started to be used because it was not designed for fisheries monitoring purposes,” says Brad Soule from Catapult, adding that the number of satellites available for monitoring AIS do make it a useful tool for other maritime domain awareness purposes as long as you “account for some of the security issues that have already been addressed in traditional vessel monitoring systems.”</p>
<p>Collecting the AIS data was only the first step towards building a more accurate picture of the types of activities and behavioral patterns of vessels in Easter Island waters, as it’s the actual correlation and overlaying of data sources which facilitates the identification of vessel types.</p>
<h2><strong>Tracking vessels that don’t want to be tracked</strong></h2>
<p>Despite huge advances in satellite monitoring technology, “it can still be rigged to fool its users, and AIS and VMS are no different,” states Tony Long from Pew. Effective use of vessel tracking systems to detect illegal fishing activities therefore requires an understanding of how vessels circumvent the system in order to go unnoticed. Moreover, it’s vital that users have a thorough understanding of the differing behavior patterns and movements between cargo vessels and fishing vessels when monitoring their tracks on a screen.</p>
<p>Off the coast of Easter Island, SkyTruth collected AIS data that revealed distinct patterns of vessel movement and enabled the detection of suspected illegal activity. For example, vessels that move very slowly and frequently change directions are typically engaged in fishing activities, whereas those moving in straight lines at a steady speed are more likely to be cargo ships moving between South America and Asia.</p>
<p>Vessels that aren’t broadcasting AIS signals could be deliberating switching them off to avoid detection, but Amos says that this lack of signal could also result from gaps in orbiting satellite coverage.</p>
<p>To ensure continued monitoring coverage, SkyTruth regularly collected radar satellite imagery to see if any vessels appeared to be operating in Easter Island waters that were not broadcasting an AIS signal. “In many cases,” says Amos, “we could not find any AIS signals for vessels that appeared on the satellite imagery.”</p>
<p>So who were these vessels?</p>
<p>Amos calls them the <em>dark fleet</em>: vessels that “operate in stealth by not publicly broadcasting their identity.” In other words, vessels likely to be carrying out illegal fishing activities.</p>
<p>“In the remote waters of Easter Island,” Amos says, “we can assume a vessel larger than 20 meters that is not broadcasting AIS is probably a commercial fishing vessel.”</p>

<h2><strong>Keeping one step ahead</strong></h2>
<p>As demonstrated by the Skytruth study—where over half of the vessels monitored did not transmit an AIS signal—illegal fishing vessels are increasingly aware that they are being monitored through their safety and anti-vessel collision transceiver.</p>
<p>Even transceivers which are designed for monitoring purposes, such as the government enforced Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), face the challenge of having the devices tampered with once installed. VMS is not applied universally and the mandatory ping rate varies per country, with most setting it at every 1- 2 hours. Experts recommend a ping rate of multiple times per hour in order to capture 100% of fishing locations.</p>
<p>With illegal fishing operations increasingly becoming aware of how the current traditional monitoring systems can be fooled, how reliable is the data being generated for analysts?</p>
<p>“It’s a good question and an important one,” says Soule from Catapult.</p>
<p>“AIS was never designed for fisheries and marine reserve monitoring. It is only recently that it has become a useful tool by virtue of the growth in the number of fishermen who want to demonstrate transparency and compliance in their operations. But you are right, by itself AIS is not a panacea without an understanding of the vessels’ identities and thereby likely activities in the context of the area of operation and specific jurisdictions.”</p>
<p>Adding information from another transceiver is one way to help build a more accurate picture.</p>
<p>“We also use vessel monitoring system (VMS) data, when it is made available, to monitor the activities of fishing vessels,” says Soule. One of the marked differences between AIS and VMS, is that the latter can be required by governments or vessel owners and do not broadcast positions publicly.</p>
<p>An experienced fisherman from a North African country explained that one way around collecting more accurate VMS data would be for governments to require vessels to have their systems on two weeks before the fishing season begins. This would “allow for better control, ahead of season” and provide a better understanding of that vessel’s behavior patterns.</p>
<p>Beyond the use of positional data relayed by transceivers to monitor specific areas, the addition of a variety of sensors, “including satellite radar and optical imagery” is also a key data component to detect the presence of vessels, explains Soule.</p>
<p>This year, the U.S. government plans to further develop an application to assist in detecting ocean vessels in countries including Indonesia and the Philippines, using the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), another form of space-based sensor. VIIRS is capable of detecting lights—including from boats that use lights to attract fishery catch at night—in order to target potentially illegal activities.</p>
<p>Advances are also being made in the speed at which the merging of data is being processed, which is a huge step forward in providing real time coverage of remote areas, especially when working in tandem with authorities who can deploy patrols to carry out further investigations.</p>
<p>“Previously it took a team of analysts 18 hours or more to analyze the data and be able to find a vessel of interest. This system brings together all of those datasets in less than 18 milliseconds,” explains Nick Wise, head of Catapult’s Ocean Sustainability business unit.</p>
<p>The new system in question is the recently launched Project Eyes on the Sea, a maritime monitoring and surveillance data platform that was developed in partnership with Catapult and the Pew Charitable Trusts.</p>
<div id="attachment_533" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-533" class="size-full wp-image-533" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room.jpg" alt="Catapult operation room (Credit: Jennifer Gillam)" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room.jpg 900w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-533" class="wp-caption-text">Catapult operation room (Credit: Jennifer Gillam)</p></div>
<p>This platform uses and merges multiple sets of data, including Vessel Monitoring Data (government collected data), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, optical imaging as well as AIS, and has been designed to enable enforcement efforts to focus on specific problem areas and vessels, cutting in time and money.</p>
<p>“We consider anything that provides a position, an identity, and some behavioral information—or any combination of these, and bring together many data sources that don’t usually exist in the same system,” explains Soule, adding that the system enables an analyst to “know where to look next.”</p>
<p>In the future, it will be able to merge and incorporate other sources of information third-party surveillance and crowd-sourced images that could originate from any person, ship, aircraft, or unmanned vehicle. Despite recent technological advances in monitoring, the high seas—an area representing two-thirds of the world’s ocean—remain notoriously difficult to monitor and patrol for illegal fishing activities. Less than one percent of the open ocean is accorded protection.</p>
<p>“At the moment, the high seas are the weakest link because of their poor management and lack of governance,” explains Professor Alex Rogers of Somerville College, Oxford.</p>
<h2><strong>Future ocean surveillance: What’s on the horizon? </strong></h2>
<p>Advanced technologies, remote surveillance tools, and satellite monitoring of the high seas have long been accessible to the military, as well as (though to a much lesser degree) governments, fisheries management agencies, and private companies such as international couriers. Since 2013, however, an important shift has taken place towards increasing access to satellite data, and also understanding the gaps in data which allow for illegal vessels to circumvent whatever moderate level of monitoring was taking place to avoid detection.</p>
<p>However, for all the progress made, satellite-based technological advances alone cannot be relied upon to curb illegal fishing or monitor newly protected areas on the high seas.</p>
<p>Nor is space-based monitoring not without its own evolutionary problems, as it “requires significant computational horsepower to bring the data together and compare the different sources to identify abnormalities,” according to Soule.</p>
<p>Satellite-based technological advances greatly reduce the human power needed to process vast quantities of data and are likely to become fully integrated into monitoring platforms ten years from now. As satellite coverage of transceivers expands and more and more governments require vessels to install them, however, they are unlikely to be relied upon alone.</p>
<p>Vessel ID registration is still not mandatory in all regions, which means that unlike traffic offenses on a speed camera, it will take some time before we have a global or even regional database linking a vessel’s ID to a tracking system, although huge progress is being made in national waters.</p>
<p>In the future, illegal fishing practices may also be curbed by the universal and mandatory application of electronically tracking fish at points of catch and sale, a regulation that an increasing amount of regional fisheries organizations are moving towards. In the long run, this is likely to shrink the market for illegal catches.</p>
<p>Today, on-site enforcement action and regular patrols in the air, at sea, and in ports, coupled with prosecution for crimes committed remain vital components in the global fight against illegal fishing.</p>
<p>Twenty years from now, however, if autonomous anti-collision drone technology continues to evolve at the predicted rate, future high-seas satellite monitoring platforms are likely to integrate this aerial surveillance tool not only as a key monitoring feature, but also one that expedites enforcement.</p>
<p>The current reality, however, is that policing remote areas of the open ocean is left in most instances to governments who have neither the means nor the human resources to properly enforce existing regulations in such remote locations. Overcoming such challenges may well require the increased use of satellite and autonomous aerial surveillance technologies &#8212; bridgingthe gap between sea and sky in a very modern way.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Antarctic is heating up.</p>
<p>As a relative newcomer, China is far from being the No.1 krill harvesting country in the Antarctic. But in April 2015, it was suddenly thrust into the spotlight when Liu Shenli, chairman of the China National Agricultural Development Group, reportedly said that China should aim to harvest one to two million tonnes of krill annually, according to the <em>China Daily </em>newspaper.</p>
<p>Liu’s ambition for China is massive when one considers the current scale of krill catch in the Antarctic. According to the Commission for the Conservation of Marine and Living Resources (CCAMLR), the top five countries together harvested 217,354 tonnes of krill in 2013 – a mere tenth or fifth of Liu’s target set for a single country.</p>
<p>In that interview, Liu said his company had so far processed 20,000 metric tonnes of krill products by April 2015. To put this into perspective, China harvested only 54,187 tonnes of krill from 2010 to 2013.</p>
<p>China began to fish in the Antarctic in 2009. Following an Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing dispute over toothfish in 2011, krill fishing has been the only exploratory activity conducted by China in the Antarctic. Unlike Norway, which harvested more than half of the krill caught in 2014, China’s share amounted to less than one fifth of the total catch.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of a detailed national development plan on krill fishing, opinions like Liu’s – who is one of the biggest Chinese businessmen in the region and a representative of the nation&#8217;s largest state-owned agricultural development enterprise – are often interpreted as signals of the will of the state.</p>
<p>But questions and concerns surround China’s future Antarctic strategy. Is China aiming to become the biggest krill fishing country in the world? What’s the potential capacity of the country’s fleets in the Antarctic? Do Chinese consumers have an appetite for these tiny little creatures from the icy Arctic depths? What’s China’s role in solving the global governance challenges in one of the planet’s last relatively untouched territories? Many questions have yet to be answered.</p>
<h2><strong>Latecomer: China looks for top spot in the Antarctic<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The exploitation of Antarctic krill dates back to the 1960s. Also known as <em>euphausia superba</em>, Antarctic krill are famous for being the largest stock of a single species in the world and play a fundamental role in the remote ecosystem.</p>
<p>China is now one of the major krill harvesting countries in the world, but it only joined the club in 2009 when the Shanghai Fishery and Dalian Liaoyu Group set sail for their first experimental krill fishing expedition in the Antarctic.</p>
<p>Despite joining late, China is aiming high. Since 2009, the exploitation of Antarctic marine resources was included in a series of high-level national plans and regulations.</p>

<p>In 2012, the Ministry of Agriculture set the tone for China’s approach towards the development of Antarctic resources with a plan entitled, “On promoting the sustainable and healthy development of distant water fishery.” This stated that China would focus on expanding fishery activities in the Antarctic under the CCAMLR framework.</p>
<p>A follow-up notice was published at the ministerial level on “strictly adhering to international Antarctic krill fishery management measures” in late 2013. The notice reiterated and localized many fishery regulations from reporting to monitoring under the CCAMLR management with the aim to “reduce and avoid violations concerning foreign affairs, and promote the sustainable and healthy development of Antarctic krill fishery.”</p>
<p>At the start of the 2013 fishery season, China announced that it was shifting from experimental to commercial krill fishing operations in the region. So far, the country has registered nine fishing vessels with CCAMLR, making Chinese fleet the largest in the region.</p>
<p>Though exploratory fishing activities were solely conducted by state-owned companies, China has opened the door to the private sector. In April 2015, the privately operated Qingdao Distant Water Fishery Company dispatched its giant vessel to the 48-1 fishery grounds in the Antarctic Ocean. The new ship, Mingkai Vessel, said to be the largest factory trawler in Asia, aims to produce 12,000 tonnes of frozen krill, with an estimated output value of US$11.7 million.</p>
<p>Another private company, tentatively named Jiangsu Blue Whale Distant Water Fishery Co., Ltd, was reported to be in the registration process, according to the Oceanic Administration in Nantong City (a coastal city near Shanghai). With registered capital of 300 million yuan (roughly US$ 47.3 million) and phase I investment of 500 million yuan (US$ 78.8 million), the company markets itself as the first domestic specialty company in Antarctic krill fishing with world-leading dredger and most advanced process facilities.</p>
<p>In line with the industrial fervor, the Chinese government has taken several actions to support Antarctic krill fishing, including establishing key research funds, launching an industry platform and creating an innovation alliance.</p>
<p>At the launch ceremony of the Antarctic Krill Major Platform on July 25<sup>th</sup> 2015, Zhao Fuxing, the director of Fishery Administration from the Ministry of Agriculture, announced that the latest goals for Antarctic krill fishing were: “To set up special projects, to grasp exploratory fishing, to strengthen the foundation, to harvest more catch, to develop deep processing, to safeguard the security and to promote development.”</p>
<p>Despite its growing presence in many government regulation texts, no official targets or development plans for krill fishing have been set.</p>
<h2><strong>Chinese consumers: Mixed appetite for ‘whale food’</strong></h2>
<p>On March 28<sup>th</sup>, 2015, China’s state-owned news agency <em>Xinhua Online</em> published an article on the rapid growth of China’s Antarctic krill industry. No longer a small scale operation after four years, the article stated that the “dream” of delivering Antarctic krill to the tables across the country was finally reachable.</p>
<p>Major online fruit and vegetable stores in China started carrying Antarctic seafood products like krill brick, dried icefish and frozen toothfish in early 2014. The popular store Origin Life now features six available products on its site. With just a few clicks, consumers from Beijing, Shanghai and other major metropolises in China can conveniently enjoy a taste of the Antarctic.</p>
<p>But Chinese consumers are hesitant to take a bite out of the budding industry.</p>
<p>Zhao Jing, a 27-year-old who works in the auction sector in Beijing, shared her experience with <em>THE </em>magazine<em>:</em> “I’ve bought four or five Antarctic products online, just for curiosity, but I don’t like the taste.”</p>
<p>Marketed as “high-protein natural seasoning” and “whale food,” the retail price of Antarctic krill brick on the website is 25.80 yuan (roughly US$ 4) per 500 grams. And it often comes with a special discount of up to 20% off. In comparison, the Arctic shrimp, or the <em>p</em><em>andalus borealis,</em> is sold at 39.00 yuan (roughly US$ 6) per 400 grams.</p>
<p>As of mid-October 2015, the product has received 1,187 reviews, but has hardly reached the average rating of other shrimp products. “Why does it smell like gas? It tastes bitter after unfreezing. Is that normal?” one reviewer asked.</p>
<div id="attachment_363" style="width: 2458px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/IMG_2245-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-363" class="size-full wp-image-363" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/IMG_2245-2.jpg" alt="Liu Shenli’s company, the China National Fisheries Corp, presented their krill products - frozen krill, krill meal, krill meatball and krill cube, at Qingdao Seafood Expo in early November 2015. (Courtesy: Liu Hongqiao)" width="2448" height="3264" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/IMG_2245-2.jpg 2448w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/IMG_2245-2-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/IMG_2245-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/IMG_2245-2-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2448px) 100vw, 2448px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-363" class="wp-caption-text">Liu Shenli’s company, the China National Fisheries Corp, presented their krill products &#8211; frozen krill, krill meal, krill meatball and krill cube, at Qingdao Seafood Expo in early November 2015. (Courtesy: Liu Hongqiao)</p></div>
<p>However, during another online promotion in May 2015, consumers showed surprising enthusiasm for frozen krill products. With the official support of China’s largest B2C website <em>Taobao</em>, a sub-company of the NASDAQ-listed Alibaba Group, 20 tonnes of quick frozen Antarctic krill harvest by the Qingdao Mingkai Vessel was sold out in 72 hours. Priced at 86.6 yuan (roughly US$13.6) per 750 grams, these krill were processed properly and packaged as krill meat cubes. Similar to earlier reviews, the majority said they enjoyed the fresh taste from the Antarctic while some complained about the strange smell, high price and cold-chain logistics.</p>
<p>According to Ying Yiping, a researcher at the Yellow Sea Fishery Research Institute, eating a small amount of krill won’t result in cumulative damage; however, with growing public concerns on food safety, the fluorine content might be an obstacle to popularizing the products.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the taste. When compared with other commercial fishery species such as toothfish from the Antarctic and tuna from the Atlantic, krill is no cheaper and many consumers simply don&#8217;t like the taste.</p>
<p>As Zhao Jing said to <em>THE magazine, </em>her purchase was mainly attracted by the special discounts and beautiful advertisements. “They look fresh and attractive, but not tasty. If the price is acceptable, I’d like to have a try. But if taste no good, then that’s end of the story.”</p>
<h2><strong>From bottom to top, Chinese industry is moving in</strong></h2>
<p>While individual consumers are developing their love and hate towards “whale food,” one potential big consumer of krill – the downstream krill processing industry – also shows limited digestive ability at the present stage.</p>
<p>According to Ying, the consistent demand for krill is not expected to come from small consumers, but from larger fishery aquaculture operations such as salmon farming as well as the demand for high-value krill oil and other extracts.</p>
<p>Barry Weeber, who is co-chair of Environment and Conservation Organisations of Aotearoa New Zealand and also an adviser of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC), however, has different opinion. In an email reply, he told THE magazine that the salmon aquaculture industry is instead using soya bean and chicken feathers as a substitute for fish products, rather than krill and krill-byproducts.</p>
<p>But what’s for sure is that high value added krill oil formulators for nutraceuticals and other extension products are attractive to investors across the world. The global landscape of deep process industry may seem interesting to many – though Norway, Korea, China and Ukraine are responsible for most of the krill catch, major deep process operates are located in Canada and Israel, which are non-CCAMLR member countries, according to Weeber.</p>
<p>In a recent <em>Xinhua</em> article, Li Lingzhi, a researcher from the East China Sea Fishery Research Institute, said highly processed products like krill oil are generally rare in the Chinese market. In fact, Antarctic krill oil was only approved as a “new food ingredient” to be legally circulate in the food industry and food market in December 2013.</p>
<p>After years of research and development under various national funding, the Chinese industry has only recently started to move in the field. In line with the goal to “develop deep processing” set by the Ministry of Agriculture, the industry is speeding up to improve technology and build up capacity.</p>
<p>Among those, the Shandong Keruier Biological Products Co., Ltd, is worth noting. The company, which is reported to have exported 70% of the global Antarctic Krill Oil raw materials, has announced plans to build “the largest comprehensive industry park on Antarctic Krill in the world,” according to <em>China Economics Online</em>, a news website attached to the state-owned Economic Daily Group.</p>
<p>With phase I investment of 170 million yuan (roughly US$ 26.7 million) and an estimated phase II investment of 250 million yuan (roughly US$ 39.3 million), the new Antarctic Krill Industry Park located in the capital city of Shandong Province aims to build up a production capacity of 100 tonnes of krill oil, high-protein peptide, high-end cosmetics and daily food products.</p>
<p>Unlike krill catch, on which reporting to CCAMLR is required on a monthly basis during the fishing season, figures on the domestic market and the industry are hardly seen in statistic books or authority reports. Therefore, it’s hard to estimate the actual scale of the krill industry in China, let alone draw a general picture from the supply chain to the market. Judging from available public information, China seems to have a large raw material process capacity and export share on certain products; but on the other hand, the technology standard and production capacity for finished products is unknown.</p>
<p>A senior researcher on China’s krill policy from Shanghai Ocean University, who asked to remain anonymous, told<em> THE magazine</em> that he was also in the dark.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the statistics on the annual output of processed products in different categories and I doubt if there were any,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Many krill products in the Chinese market are imported rather than produced by China.”</p>
<h2><strong>What’s next? A vague message from China</strong></h2>
<p>With China now in the final year of its 12th Five-Year Plan period, all major departments from the central government are working on drafting a new economic agenda. Will China publish a comprehensive strategy for the Antarctic ocean for the next five years? Chances seem high.</p>
<p>A few months ago, for the first time ever, China embedded its polar strategy into law. In its new National Security Law issued on July 1<sup>st</sup> 2015, China declared the country’s intent to “adhere to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, the international seabed and polar regions.” In addition to upgrading polar exploration to a national security level, the law also said that China will safeguard the security of such activities in these regions.</p>
<p>“We [China] do have many plans and documents on Antarctic krill fishing, but those are classified. Without such documents, Liu Shenli can’t be that confident to boast,” a delegate in the Chinese negotiation team at CCAMLR told <em>THE </em>Magazine. “And that’s all I can comment.” He also refused to reveal his name.</p>
<p>In contrast with such caution, increased exploration activities, the growing krill harvest, and strong investment from both state-owned and private companies have placed China in a tricky position regarding Antarctic krill conservation and exploration. The scientific community and many international parties have expressed concerns about the Chinese government’s vague plans in the Antarctic region. One of the major concerns is whether or not would China expand its krill catch in the coming years.</p>
<p>“The whole world has to guess what exactly are China’s intentions in the Antarctic,” Chen Jiliang, a researcher of Policy Center from Greenovation Hub, told <em>THE Magazine</em>. Chen has been observing the CCAMLR conference since 2012 as an ASOC delegate. According to him, domestic academic community has been urging China to demonstrate and publicize its interest in Antarctica in the form of a white paper or other similar policy document, but progress on this seems to be slow.</p>
<p>“We’re far from reaching the verdict of China becoming the largest harvesting country. There are many potentials for further studies,” Liu Qin, a researcher from the Information Strategy Research Center of the East China Sea Fishery Research Institute, said via email.</p>
<p>Chen believes that China has passed the period of &#8220;making a big fortune without being noticed.&#8221; And he is not alone. Xue Guifang, Chair Professor of KoGuan Law School in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, also agrees that China could and should take a role as a “responsible power” in the region. To start, she says, the country should change its hesitant and uncertain attitude.</p>

But many say it tastes too “fishy”. (Courtesy: Liu Hongqiao)</p></div>
<p>“Let’s be clear &#8212; there is nothing wrong with pursuing its legitimate interests in the Antarctic. The lacking of a clear national strategy in the region, however, will cast a shadow on China’s international image,” Prof. Xue said.</p>
<p>She also warns about the uncertain investment risks under the current ambiguous national strategy on Antarctic krill exploration. Without proper guidance from the government, she said, the industry can easily become short-sighted as investors will rush to achieve their economic returns as soon as possible under an ambiguous regulatory situation. As a result, companies tend to harvest as much as their capacity allows, which is not sustainable to maintain either China’s responsible image or the krill stock.</p>
<p>Whether it’s China or any other country to expand the harvest, the risks are real &#8211; more krill in the market would reduce already low prices and it remains to be seen if global consumers have a taste for the product.</p>
<h2><strong>Moving towards stringent global governance</strong></h2>
<p>Following the commitment of world leaders at the Rio+20 in Brazil in 2012 to address the protection of the high seas, the world is now moving towards a legally binding treaty to protect its living resources and biodiversity.</p>
<p>On June 19, 2015, the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly adopted a resolution to launch a new global treaty on marine life conservation in the high seas. A commission has been set up to prepare further negotiations.</p>
<p>“If the treaty would be passed by the U.N.’s 193 member countries in 2017 or 2018, it will be the Kyoto Protocol of the high seas. It’s epoch-making,” Chen Jiliang said to <em>THE Magazine</em>.</p>
<p>According to the U.N., the new treaty will be under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea as well as the General Assembly. In addition to fishery resource management, it will also touch on hot topics like genetic resource utilization and deep ocean exploitation. Once passed, it would be the first comprehensive international treaty on the global ocean governance in the last two decades.</p>
<p>Prof. Xue is also positive about the new treaty. According to her, it would give more power to the regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs). Krill fishing as well as toothfish and icefish in the Antarctic Ocean would then be exposed to stronger and much more stringent management under international law. The landscape of future marine fishery exploitation in Antarctic ocean would look very different.</p>
<p>“The age of operating free of regulation on the high seas will soon be gone. China should change its thinking right now and prepare for the changes,” Prof. Xue said.</p>
<p>While the country’s attitude on resource development is ambiguous, China continues to publicly push a conservation agenda.  During President Xi Jinping’s visit to the U.S. in September 2015, China announced it planned to cooperate on building a conservation zone in the Antarctic&#8217;s Ross Sea.</p>
<p>But during this year’s annual CCAMLR meeting in Hobart, Australia in October, fierce debate on krill fisheries once again took center stage. Issues such as the aforementioned conservation zone, as well as plans to raise the tariff on krill resources, and improve vessel position reporting frequency and observer coverage were tabled. Observation groups pointed the finger at China, who they say blocked progress for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>While current disputes under the CCAMLR framework are mainly focused on krill stock monitoring and fishery management, it&#8217;s climate change, not fishing activities that remain the most urgent threat to Antarctic krill. Scientists <a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v3/n9/full/nclimate1937.html">warn</a> that unless carbon dioxide emission are mitigated, otherwise by 2300 the Antarctic krill population could collapse and cause dire consequences for the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>At the climate negotiations last December in Paris, world leaders adopted a legal-binding agreement that sets the goal to hold global temperature warming to within 2℃ by 2100. The importance of maintaining the integrity of ocean ecosystems and protecting biodiversity was also discussed. Will future actions to address climate change expose the krill fishery business to additional risk? It seems likely. Business leaders like Liu Shenli should probably think twice before taking another bold move in the Antarctic.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idyllic Pacific Northwest has long been a seafood-oriented place. Surrounded by water and mountainscapes, you can see its reliance on seafood running all the way back to ancient Native American ceremonies and totems. Today, Seattle is home to much of the Alaska fishing fleet, and Washington and Oregon are healthy producers of oysters, Dungeness crab, geoduck, and other prized seafood.</p>
<p>However, in the late 2000s, that way of life was called into question when ocean acidification turned up on the scene: causing massive die-offs of very young oyster larvae, called “seed.” While the ocean is alkaline, and will always be that way, ocean acidification is the term used to describe the process of the ocean gradually becoming more acidic due to absorption of carbon dioxide (C0<sub>2</sub>) emissions. Nearly a third of carbon emissions released into the atmosphere are absorbed by the ocean. Once upon a time people thought that was a good thing: that the ocean was doing us a favor, and there would be no additional consequences. Well, that fantasy is over.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the addition of C0<sub>2</sub> has been fundamentally changing the chemistry of seawater. These changes are illustrated twofold: first, the pH of the ocean is gradually decreasing. Healthy seawater has a pH of 8.1, but since the output of anthropogenic (human-caused) carbon emissions began, a .11 decrease in the global average pH of the surface ocean has been observed. The pH scale is logarithmic, which means a pH decrease of .11 is actually a 30% increase in acidity (a change more rapid than any observed in the last 300 million years). In some places, like the Pacific Northwest, the change to seawater has been even more dramatic, due to the upwelling of carbon-rich, deep ocean water to the surface each year, which exacerbates the effects of ocean acidification (OA). The pH can be as low as 7.5 in certain “hot-spots.”</p>
<p>Secondly, the addition of CO<sub>2</sub> to the ocean causes a harmful chemical reaction. Carbon dioxide binds with water and carbonate ions to produce bicarbonate. For creatures that rely on plentiful carbonate to build their shells (like oysters, clams, shrimp, mussels, crab, and others), this change to the chemistry compromises their ability to do so.</p>

From the very first day of their life, oysters begin to build shells using just the energy in their yolks, and that can be inhibited by acidity and cause the shell buiding may fail. The first few days of growth are crucial, Waldbusser told news media: &quot;They must build their first shell quickly on a limited amount of energy--and along with the shell comes the organ to capture external food,&quot; said Waldbusser. The unfavorable ocean water has high amounts of pCO2 (determined by dissolved CO2 and carbonic acid), and low concentration of aragonite, the kind of calcium carbonate used by shellfish to grow their shells. Such water conditions occur at Dabob Bay, home of the Taylor hatchery and Netarts Bay, OR, where the Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery is located. Whiskey Creek was a close collaborator in recent research by Waldbusser, Brunner and colleagues, showing how oysters are affected by ocean changes brought on by CO2 emissions.

<p>Multiplying the effects of OA are other changing ocean conditions, such as warming, nutrient runoff, pollution, and disease. Known as multi-stressor scenarios, when these conditions combine – as they often do in the Pacific – it can create a domino effect of weakening marine foodwebs and organisms’ health. As Eric Sanford, professor of evolution and ecology at the University of California, Davis and lead author on a study of OA combined with other stressors, said, &#8220;You might decide to go to work if you had a toothache. But what if you had a toothache, the flu, and a broken leg? At some point, multiple stressors will cause natural systems to break down.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Oysters Become the “Canary in the Coal Mine”</strong></h2>
<p>Before local seawater chemistry turned against them, most oyster farmers in estuaries along the coast of the Northwest relied at least partially on wild seed – the oysters in the estuary would spawn and the seed would settle on old shells and other rough surfaces, “set” there, and the growers would tend them until ready for harvest. Many growers also supplemented with seed from hatcheries, which pump in seawater to breed and sustain large tanks of oyster larvae, and then sell it in varying sizes and quantities to growers who want to boost their numbers.</p>
<p>While OA had been a subject of scientific study for some time, conditions were not expected to harm marine organisms until 2050, and back in 2007, the term “ocean acidification” was known to only a small circle.</p>
<p>That is, until something started happening at Whiskey Creek Hatchery, in Netarts Bay, Oregon, which had been farming oysters commercially for over 150 years, and provides over 3000 family wage jobs in rural areas along the coastline. After 30 years of consistent production of oyster larvae, in 2007 and 2008 they started experiencing losses that reduced production substantially and unsustainably. As hatchery manager Alan Barton says, “The bottleneck in supply always has been and always will be producing enough larvae to meet the needs of our growers. Now that we’re having problems producing larvae in our hatchery, it’s already had a pretty big economic impact on our industry, to the tune of tens of millions of dollars per year in lost harvested product.”</p>
<div id="attachment_30" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/Alan-Barton-pic.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30" class="wp-image-30 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/Alan-Barton-pic-765x1024.jpg" alt="Whiskey Creek Hatchery manager Alan Barton " width="760" height="1017" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/Alan-Barton-pic-765x1024.jpg 765w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/Alan-Barton-pic-224x300.jpg 224w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/Alan-Barton-pic-598x800.jpg 598w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/Alan-Barton-pic.jpg 1936w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-30" class="wp-caption-text">Whiskey Creek Hatchery manager Alan Barton</p></div>
<p>The usual suspects, like disease, were ruled out, and funding was collected to bring scientists in to identify the problem. They concluded that ocean acidification was to blame. The combination of carbon and nutrient rich deep ocean water upwelling along the west coast and carbon dioxide emissions absorbed from the atmosphere had caused a tipping point. Every year since this discovery, from California to British Columbia, monitoring systems have consistently documented water corrosive enough to dissolve fragile young larval shells, and it affects every grower and every hatchery along that coastline. At the same time, wild sets of oyster seed ceased to be available because they died in the first 48 hours of spawning. This made oyster farmers entirely reliant on hatcheries, and many growers had to invest in costly capital equipment like larval setting tanks, increasing expenses by 30% or more a year.</p>
<p>Before Barton experienced all of this for himself, he was the last person to call himself an environmentalist, and didn’t have a particular stance on climate change. The concepts, he says, are complicated to understand, but critical for his industry going forward. “It nearly drove us out of business in 2009, and continues to have a big economic impact on our industry. Thanks to monitoring we’re able to find times of years that are safer to spawn, and thanks to sophisticated water treatment systems, we can treat our hatchery water to maintain healthy production.”</p>
<p>According to Barton, Whiskey Creek installed automatic buffering systems in 2011 in order to maintain a constant pH in the hatchery. But even he admits it’s only a short term fix. “Every year we can see it getting harder to fix the water. And every year our production changes as a result of that,” he says. “We want to work in the hatchery and produce larvae. But we’re forced to start thinking about the global problem of CO2 emissions, because we have no other option. Some of you guys might not like oysters, but food webs that affect salmon, cod, crab, shrimp, and lots of other important seafood is also at risk.”</p>
<p>The life-long oysterman reiterates that he’s not an environmentalist, but the problems facing his industry require action on a larger scale. “If we continue down the road that we’re on, in terms of emissions, there won’t be oyster farmers by the turn of the century,” he says. “We have often been referred to as the canary in the coal mine, but if you’re familiar with the history of that phrase, the canary has to die so that everyone else can make it out safe. We don’t want to be the canary in the coal mine. It’s time to make some hard decisions that can keep us going in the future.”</p>
<p>For now, west coast hatcheries use expensive real-monitoring water monitoring systems that detect when seawater conditions are harmful, and add sodium carbonate to buffer it sufficiently to protect delicate larvae. But as Barton mentioned, it is becoming more difficult each year and none feel confident of a long-term future. For family-owned businesses in their fourth and fifth generations, this is a real blow. For them, oyster farming is a way of life and they can’t imagine spending their days any other way.</p>
<h2><strong>King Crab on the Hook</strong></h2>
<p>Another iconic seafood, the red king crab, looks to be vulnerable to OA, and stakeholders are scrambling to find a solution. One group is looking to hatcheries as a partial fix. Now for the first time, hatchery-reared juvenile red king crab have been released into the wild, and results are back on the viability of restocking areas where populations have been devastated, or where future OA hot-spots may kill young red king crab, which have proven to be particularly susceptible to OA conditions.</p>
<div id="attachment_25" style="width: 534px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/Baby-crab-by-Alutiq-Hatchery-e1448071641386.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25" class="wp-image-25 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/Baby-crab-by-Alutiq-Hatchery-e1448071641386.jpg" alt="Baby crab by Alutiq Hatchery" width="524" height="600" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/Baby-crab-by-Alutiq-Hatchery-e1448071641386.jpg 524w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/Baby-crab-by-Alutiq-Hatchery-e1448071641386-262x300.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-25" class="wp-caption-text">Baby red king crab (Photo credit: Alutiq Hatchery)</p></div>
<p>A 2013 <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0060959">report</a> shows that red king crab juveniles experience 100% mortality rates when exposed to pH 7.5 for 95 days. While the Pacific Northwest regularly experiences such conditions, Alaskan waters are still generally in the healthy range of 8.0 pH, for now. But Robert Foy, one of the authors of the report, predicts natural breeding and successful survival of red king crab to fail within 20-30 years of Alaskan waters reaching pH 7.8 (expected within 30 years). The <em>Seattle Times</em> <a href="http://apps.seattletimes.com/reports/sea-change/2013/sep/11/alaska-crab-industry/">reported on the study</a> and its implications last year in their award-winning Sea Change series.</p>
<p>These potentially dangerous conditions, however, might not be as far in the future as we thought. Jeremy Mathis, a well-known OA researcher for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), found disturbing evidence about current conditions: “What we actually found is that in certain times of the year, the [pH] conditions near the bottom in the Bering Sea <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064513002932">were actually worse</a> than the conditions that Bob was raising his crabs under [in the lab].” Fortunately, there’s no evidence that OA is currently affecting wild populations; the critical times when Mathis’ study found the sea to be most corrosive happen during a part of the crab life cycle when they are not as vulnerable. However, there’s no denying that stocks are dwindling and have been for some time &#8211; even in places where fishing has been banned -but a specific cause has yet to be isolated.</p>
<p>Red king crab is a lucrative fishery, and many fortunes have been built on it over the last century. You see its iconic image reflected all over the Northwest and Alaska, and real estate investments born from king crab money abound today in both areas. At Seattle’s famous Pike Place market, king crab can command as much as $39.99 a pound. In addition to its delicious flesh, the fishery itself became hugely popular through the reality TV show “Deadliest Catch,” which exposed audiences to the dangerous nature and the emotional highs and lows of crab fishing. But for those who rely on healthy king crab stocks for their living, particularly those who own quota and fishing vessels, the look at the future predicted by this OA research is troubling. For many multi-generational fishing families, there’s a strong chance that their children and grandchildren will not be able to carry on the crab fishing legacy. Adding that in some places king crab stocks are already down from historic levels, as well as threatened by other issues like warming seas, some in the industry felt compelled to act by forming new partnerships. Others are diversifying to other fisheries, while still others are continuing with business as usual. Jim Stone, co-owner of a Bering Sea crab vessel, the <em>F/V Arctic Hunter</em>, told the <em>Seattle Times</em>, “We’re scared to death, but we’ve heard a lot of horror stories before.”</p>
<p>Seeking to get ahead of the curve is the Alaska King Crab Research, Rehabilitation and Biology program (AKCRRAB), a joint program supported by industry, natives, Alaskan communities, and state and federal programs. Their attention turned to an experiment led by Alutiq Pride Shellfish Hatchery, which had already been underway for some years, to restock crab populations around Kodiak Island where levels had crashed forty years ago. That experiment took on a new meaning and garnered new attention with the threat of ocean acidification.</p>
<p>Alutiq Pride Shellfish Hatchery is at the center of rearing crab larvae, they’ve spent years learning how to do it as part of the Kodiak restocking effort. Along with producing stocks of oysters, geoducks, abalone, butter clams, and sea cucumbers, they also raise juvenile red and blue king crab larvae. Crab fishing vessels help the hatchery collect pregnant females, and Alutiq Pride raises broodstock on site. Now the result of years of experimentation is coming to fruition, with the successful outplanting of hatchery-reared crab into the wild.</p>
<p>Broodstock collected from Alitak Bay in fall of 2013 was reared until August 2014, when 11,250 red king crab juveniles were released into experimental 5&#215;5 meter plots in Trident Basin, near Kodiak, Alaska. Their survival in the wild has been carefully tracked since the time of release, with varied trial crab densities and predator density monitored. At the last reporting, AKCCRAB found that after 65% die-off in the first 24 hours (similar to losses in other hatchery-reared animals released into the wild) survival rates of hatchery-reared crab are about the same as that of wild juveniles – supporting the theory that artificially restocking the area is ecologically viable. After that initial mortality, the loss rate of hatchery crab and wild populations equalized, indicating that outplanting works and that future releases of juveniles could be made in higher numbers.</p>
<p>Three more outplantings took place this year, and mortality and efficiency are increasing with each attempt. Alutiq began the year with 400,000 red king crab larvae and 15,000 blue king crab larvae in March, when larvae hatching was underway. Such large numbers are necessary to start, because cannibalism is rampant among hatchery reared juveniles – as many as 50% are lost with each molting. Larvae from numerous females are being utilized to preserve genetic diversity in the stock. They can also do full parental genotyping, so progeny can always be traced back to the mother. Larvae are fed on algae until they molt into the first juvenile stage. In each round of outplanting, AKCCRAB experimented with variables to increase survival: like releasing crabs of different sizes, and releasing at night when the threat from predators could be lower. NOAA teams will continue to monitor all of the released juveniles through the winter, until March 2016.</p>
<p>These experiments indicate significant progress for Alutiq Pride and AKCCRAB. The project has brought together collaborators from across the board: the fishing industry, tribal interests, Alaskan communities, and organizations from both state and local government. At long last the project is bearing fruit, and there’s some hope in the use of hatchery-reared king crab to support natural stocks. Hatchery manager Jeff Hetrick says, “The big picture is reestablishing stocks, but we’re also learning techniques and technology that are pretty amazing.”</p>
<p>Now that multiple experimental releases have proved successful, Hetrick says, “Alutiq Pride can start ramping up production, releasing a couple hundred thousand next year.” That will be the final year of experimentation. After that, they will be using the technology to take the project to the next level and actively reestablish crab stocks.</p>
<p>But nobody believes that hatcheries can fully replace wild populations of red king crab. The amount of juveniles needed to populate the Bering Sea alone boggles the mind. “We’re hoping that it never gets to the point that they rely on the hatchery for that kind of work,” Hetrick says. “If we get to that point I think we’re in trouble. But it is a possibility.” However, perfecting the science might help restock populations in devastated areas, and the industry can be ahead of the curve in hatchery-rearing king crab as the pH continues to drop in ocean waters around the world. Hetrick adds, “With what we’ve learned in the last few years, ocean chemistry is changing rapidly for the worse, and the work that we’re doing is vital for sustaining crab populations.”</p>

<p>Just as oyster growers in the Pacific Northwest now rely solely on hatchery-reared oyster seed while the rest of the world can count on wild sets, it might be that future Alaskan OA hot-spots will need some help from hatcheries to support crab populations. While AKCCRAB is hoping that we never see that future, they are leading the fishing industry by getting the heavy lifting of the science perfected <em>before</em> mortality events catch them off guard.</p>
<h2><strong>A Strand of Hope</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ecy.wa.gov/water/marine/oceanacidification.html">The Washington State Blue Ribbon Panel on Ocean Acidification</a> was formed by Governor Christine Gregoire in 2012 to identify potential OA adaptation, mitigation, and remediation actions. One of the most promising is the use of vegetation, like eelgrass and kelp, to help “sweeten” the water. When plants photosynthesize, they absorb carbon dioxide from the water, and cause the seawater’s pH to go up. This action is called phytoremediation. A lot of research is currently underway to investigate its efficacy in creating “OA refugia.” The idea of an OA refuge is that certain small geographical areas could, through the use of naturally occurring materials, create a small halo area where OA is reduced or even eliminated.</p>
<p>Betsy Peabody, of the Puget Sound Restoration Fund, speaks about a recent grant they received from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation to investigate the use of kelp for OA remediation. When asked if she believes that the seaweed project will produce enough of a change to seawater chemistry to create an OA refuge, Peabody said: “Everyone on the project team feels like if there is an effect it will certainly be localized, but the important point is that it is replicable. It can be used to help mitigate OA hot-spots. Hopefully, we’ll see that a kelp cultivation array will reduce nitrogen and carbon locally, plus provide other ecosystem services. The concept of refuges is really important, we have to find ways to improve and maintain conditions for important calcifiers [oysters, clams, crab, mussels].”</p>
<p>At the same time, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources and the University of Washington have been investigating the changes in pH that the presence of eelgrass creates. They established experiments at five sites, and found that while photosynthesizing, eelgrass raised the pH at a rate of .05 units per hour. Areas with eelgrass also maintained a higher pH at night (when not photosynthesizing).</p>
<p>This gives some promise for the hope of mitigating the effects of OA in the short term, in the areas that need it most – economically and ecologically valuable sites, or in certain “hot-spots.” But until carbon emissions are drastically reduced globally, seafood is on a slippery slope. Ocean acidification legislation has been lucky to find bipartisan support in a way that climate change generally does not, and seven coastal states have now addressed OA through expert panels, task forces, or other state legislation. In the big picture though, seafood producers are left wondering if there will be a future for the next generation.</p>
