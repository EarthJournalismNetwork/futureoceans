								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Restoration</h2>
<p>What is a coral, really? It’s an animal, but it is also plantlike, an alien amalgam of many clades. It is made up of minuscule individuals and yet its colonies comprise the largest living structures in the natural world.</p>
<p>Zooming in reveals the tiny components and processes that make up the organism: the fleshy coral polyp within its calcium carbonate skeleton; the microscopic algae that live in symbiosis inside the cells of the animal; the complex microbial communities that live in and around all of them. You’d also observe the way ocean chemistry interacts intimately with the creatures, changing their ability to grow, or the way a half-degree difference in temperature can upset their delicately balanced cellular machinery.</p>
<p>Zooming out to the reefs themselves reveals geological structures reaching up from the seafloor, growing from millions of tiny mouths and built on the compiled skeletons of previous generations. These house fish and sea urchins that graze on the algae that might otherwise overgrow the corals, larger fish that eat <em>them</em>, and species like sharks, whose existence marks a well-balanced ecosystem and whose absence indicates disorder. Other organisms prey on the coral itself: The crown-of-thorns starfish is so fecund and insatiable that a single individual can populate whole square miles of reef, stripping the coral of its polyps and leaving dead, white skeletons behind.</p>
<p>Humans have a way of messing with coral at both ends of the scale, from altering the very chemistry of the water they grow in, to destroying thousands of miles of reef by dredging, polluting, overfishing, and just generally overloading them.</p>
<p>But some people think that in order to fix coral, we’ll have to keep meddling. We’ll just have to do it better.</p>
<div style="width: 1330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/bg-main2.jpg?w=1320&amp;h=688" alt="" width="1320" height="687" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Coral Restoration Foundation’s nursery is made up of PVC-pipe “trees” where corals grow quickly in the nutrient-rich current.Coral Restoration Foundation</p></div>
<p><strong>Ken Nedimyer, founder of the Coral Restoration Foundation, leans hard on the coral-as-trees metaphor.</strong> If you can regrow a forest from a nursery, he thought, why not a reef? Aside from a few frustrating particulars and unknowns about coral husbandry, the model made sense to him. But no one had tried it.</p>
<p>In 40 years of diving in the Florida Keys, Nedimyer has watched the place change into something unrecognizable: “The reefs I saw in the early ‘70s were just fabulous. I remember going to Carysfort, and it was just acres and acres of elkhorn coral, coming right to the surface. You couldn’t swim over it; you couldn’t see the end of it. Most of the reefs in the Florida Keys were like that.”</p>
<p>As the stepping-stone islands filled up with people, the surrounding seas filled up with their boats and sewage. Until very recently, wastewater from the Florida Keys was flushed right out to sea or pumped into leaky septic systems. As a result, all those spectacular near-shore reefs that had made the place famous suffered a 30-year-long string of disease outbreaks, algal blooms, dredging, damage from boats, and overfishing. Today, the Carysfort Reef has mostly turned to skeletal rubble, overgrown with algae and largely empty of fish.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/rounded-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong>The problem with coral in the Keys is not unique in the Caribbean. </strong>A <a href="http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/caribbean_coral_reefs___status_report_1970_2012.pdf">comprehensive study</a> of the Caribbean’s reefs from 1972 to 2012 found that coral declined by more than 80 percent, with most of that loss concentrated in the 80s and 90s. An outbreak of White Band Disease knocked out almost all of the region’s staghorn and elkhorn corals — the branching corals that make up the bulk of the region’s reef structure. Another disease wiped out the local sea urchins that kept algae in check. Then in 1997 and 1998, the <a href="http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/techrpts/tr9802/tr9802.pdf">strongest-ever El Niño</a> observed to-date hit, and ocean temperatures shot up. Caribbean corals, struggling in the hot water, expelled their symbiotic algae and slowly starved to death, in some of the worst bleaching events in the history.</p>
<p>In the late 90’s, a series of papers proclaimed the end of reefs, eventual or imminent. Even if we could stop dumping so much sewage and sludge on the reefs, we almost certainly couldn’t stop the global warming that had already started raising ocean temperatures above the threshold at which coral survival seemed impossible. Surely these fragile creatures, the foundation for so many critical ecosystems, would not be able to exist in that hot future world. Surely, they were all doomed.</p>
<p>But what seemed like a foregone conclusion to pessimistic scientists seemed like a call to arms for others. Nedimyer was of the latter. An aquarium collector, he spent most of his time underwater, catching tropical fish to sell to public and private aquariums. When an elkhorn coral started to grow on some aquarium “live rock” he was tending, Nedimyer had an idea. While elkhorn is a federally protected species in the Caribbean, the law was that anything growing on Ken’s live rock — including elkhorn — belonged to him. He could do what he wanted with it.</p>
<p>Nedimyer knew he could probably make a tidy fortune by growing the rare coral to sell cuttings to aquariums. But he wanted to do something bigger. So Nedimyer and his 13-year-old daughter started with a 4H project, fragmenting the original coral to grow each piece into a new colony. They were practicing for the nursery Nedimyer had pictured, an enormous underwater forest capable of restoring the Caribbean’s reefs to their former state, the way he had known them 40 years before.</p>
<div style="width: 1330px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wpa1_b_jan-2014.jpg?w=1320&amp;h=990" alt="" width="1320" height="990" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A thicket of transplanted staghorn coral takes root in the Florida Keys. Grist | Amelia Urry</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In 2003,</strong> Nedimyer got federal permission to plant six corals in a spot on Molasses Reef in the Florida Keys. In 2007, after a string of bad luck and hurricanes that kept them off the reef, they planted 18. In 2015, Nedimyer and the small staff of the Coral Restoration Foundation, along with a legion of volunteers, planted more than 18,000 of them.</p>
<p>Jessica Levy manages the CRF’s restoration program, which means she is out on the water most days — gathering corals from the nurseries, monitoring for signs of trouble, and planting new batches of coral on the reef. The corals she works with are the offspring of wild patches of elkhorn and staghorn that survived the mass die-offs of the last few decades.</p>
<p>“If they’ve gone through bleaching events and survived, if they’ve gone through cold events and survived, they’re a stronger coral,” Levy says. “They’re the ones that you want to fragment and grow and plant back on the reef. The idea being, if they survived it then, they’ll survive it now.”</p>
<p>In the nursery, coral grow two or three times faster than they grow on the reef. Suspended in the water column, they can gather nutrients from the current and grow in all directions without expending energy to affix themselves to the reef. Once planted, they spend a few months stabilizing, forming new tissue over the epoxy used to cement them in place. Then they start growing again.</p>
<p>Since they’re planted in groups of the same genotype, the corals grow together as they get bigger, forming tangled thickets that provide the kind of shelter and support a reef so badly needs. Levy says that, so far, about 80 percent of the transplants are still alive after two years on the reef. Impressive results, especially considering no one has ever tried a project like this at scale before.</p>
<div style="width: 1330px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dsc_0022.jpg?w=1320&amp;h=880" alt="" width="1320" height="880" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A volunteer coordinator for CRF readies a boatload of divers.Grist | Amelia Urry</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Nedimyer and Levy and the rest of CRF know they are facing a Herculean task if they expect to replant all of Florida’s reefs by hand. But, luckily, they don’t. Even the reefs where they’ve been planting corals since the beginning are still mostly bare, featuring the odd thicket of staghorn or stubborn boulder coral.</p>
<p>Levy says CRF’s real goal is not to repopulate the reefs coral by coral, but to preserve the genetic diversity the species needs to stay resilient. By gathering corals from the reef, CRF can save genotypes that might otherwise be lost from the wild. Eventually, if CRF can just boost population density a little, the corals can start reproducing on their own again.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest obstacles is that as these populations stand now, when they do go to spawn, they’re so far apart,” Levy points out. Corals are hermaphroditic, producing bundles of both sperm and eggs during a yearly spawning event, but elkhorn and staghorn can’t fertilize themselves. They trust that their spawn will mingle in the water column, meet other coral spawn, fertilize, and avoid being eaten long enough to settle out and start growing new coral. But right now, says Levy, “these guys are so fragmented that there’s no chance of meeting up.”</p>
<p>“It’s a big ocean. The goal was never to outplant every coral on every reef. That’s not sustainable,” Levy says, on a rare day in her office on land. That’s the part that can be hard to explain to people, who can’t see the point of scattering a few thousand corals across reefs that once hosted millions. “The goal is to get genetic diversity out there, to the point where they’re naturally reproducing. Basically, to boost natural recovery.”</p>
<p>If that sounds like a big gamble to you – it is. But it might be our best bet.</p>

<p><strong>To plant a coral, you first have to clear a place for it.</strong> You do this (I am a little alarmed to learn) with the chisel end of a hammer.</p>
<p>The day after we gathered our coral cuttings from the nursery, we go out on Molasses Reef, one of the most visited reefs in the Keys. I take a hammer from Patty and tentatively begin tapping the reef substrate, a compressed residue of coral rubble and sand, riddled with strange, iridescent sea worms.</p>
<p>This is not easy. Picture an astronaut trying to hammer a nail in space: For every fraction of an inch the nail goes in, the astronaut floats back a foot. In my case, each careful chisel blow to the rock sends me drifting upward like an untethered balloon. To stay down, I have to direct my head and all my attention downward while kicking steadily, as I scrape the rock clear of its algal fuzz.</p>
<p>I brace my coral firmly against a spot on the cleared substrate with one hand, while with the other I pinch off small globs of purple epoxy. Each branch gets a dab, and the whole thing goes down onto the spot I’ve cleared.</p>
<p>At least in theory: Between my own drift and wafting clouds of sediment from the divers chiseling on either side of me, it takes some maneuvering before I can get my branch of staghorn anchored firmly to the rock. To test its structural integrity, I wave my hand over it like I’m trying to fan out a flame. Sediment flies up in a cloud, but my coral — it stays put. Success.</p>
<p>It takes about 40 minutes for four of us to plant all 10 corals in one thicket, an area easily encompassed by a hula-hoop. As all the groups start to ascend, I can’t help but think that it doesn’t look like much. Together, we have managed to plant a single milk-crate’s worth of corals over a badminton court-sized patch of seafloor. This on the bare, rocky remains of a reef that stretches to the limits of visibility.</p>
<p>But something happens as we continue to rise. Fish dart in to fill the space we have made, rushing to gulp the worms we’ve dislodged in all that scraping and hammering. Suddenly, our sad jumble of coral looks a lot more like a habitat.</p>
<p>From 20 feet above the sea floor, I can see thickets of staghorn planted in the previous year or so. I can see how the disparate pieces of coral have grown up and together, knitting their branches into a kind of a dome. I can see, finally, where they have grown over the epoxy lumps that first sealed them to the reef. They have already taken root.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>From the boat, there’s nothing remarkable about the place — just choppy water and a white mooring ball, a few miles off Key Largo. But once we’re underwater, I can see the rows and rows of PVC trees, suspended above the sand in a grid that stretches away into the distant murk.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/reef.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-101 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/reef.jpg" alt="reef" width="100" height="79" /></a></p>
<p>This is a coral nursery. Each tree bears a ripening crop of a hundred or more pieces of coral. The smallest fragments are pinkie-sized, twirling on their tethers as other divers kick by; the largest hang like many-limbed chandeliers, turning slowly in the current. When I get closer, I can see the individual polyps, the anemone-like creatures that make up each fragmented colony. Nestled in the crenellated openings in their solid skeletons, they are waving their fleshy tentacles through the water, feeding.</p>
<p>We are there to tend the trees: Each one needs to be surveyed, scrubbed of algae, and have its biggest corals subdivided into new cuttings. Any coral bleached by high temperatures or damaged by disease needs to be removed to a nearby heap. This is a daunting task considering that the Coral Restoration Foundation (CRF) maintains five coral nurseries with some 40,000 corals growing on trees just like these ones, all along the spattered arc of the Florida Keys.</p>
<p>Exaggerating her gestures, a woman named Patty shows us — a group of long-time volunteers and visiting divers — how to hang new cuttings in place of the corals we cut down. We exhale long streamers of air back toward the surface, and move slowly as we pass the shared pliers around, cutting and crimping monofilament with the slow-motion care of astronauts maneuvering in zero gravity.</p>
<p>I pick up a piece of coral, maybe eight inches long and forked at both ends. It’s a deep amber, except for the bright white tips of its branches. It’s hard to tell how heavy an object is underwater, but this one feels light: A small thing to pin the reef’s future on. I tag it with the name and number of its tree, and drop it into a milk crate with the others we’ve harvested.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to go plant a reef.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/rounded-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-94 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/rounded-2.jpg" alt="rounded-2" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/rounded-2.jpg 150w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/rounded-2-87x87.jpg 87w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I got here with a question:</strong> What happens to coral reefs as the ocean warms and acidifies over the coming century? Corals might seem removed from human society, but in fact that not-so-simple question leads to an even scarier follow-up: What happens to us?</p>
<p>Coral reefs are the richest ocean ecosystems we have — they support an estimated 25 percent of marine species. According to <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3720e.pdf">a 2014 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization</a>, reefs are responsible for 17 percent of the protein we consume globally; in some coastal or island countries, like Sierra Leone or the Maldives, that number can be as high as 70 percent. Reefs serve as offshore larders, nurseries for important commercial fish (like tuna), and shelter for important ecological species (like sharks). They’re storm breaks for populated shores and bait for tourists whose dollars support entire local economies.</p>
<p>We know that reefs are crucial to the oceans as we know them, and to our societies as we’ve made them — and we know they are in serious trouble. According to one 2000 report, <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Coral/">we’ve lost</a> 27 percent of coral worldwide, and stand to lose another 32 percent in the next 30 years.</p>
<p>What we don’t know is if there’s anything we can do about it. Luckily, that won’t stop people from trying: Around the world, a scrappy handful of scientists, entrepreneurs, and volunteers are taking on this colossal problem, one branch at a time.</p>
<p>From regrowing the reefs we’ve already lost to engineering new corals that may be able to survive hotter, more acidic seas, these innovators are fighting everything from nutrient pollution to overfishing to discarded fishing nets to ocean warming itself. If we want to succeed, we might have to learn how to rewrite an entire ecosystem from the bottom up.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Making impactful, visual indicators of our changing climate isn’t an easy task. Climate change is a gradual process, so it’s difficult to visibly show people what’s happening. Our oceans are changing, but we don’t notice the centimeter waters have risen or the amount they’re acidifying. But coral bleaching and reef decline are capturable: There are stark visual differences between thriving coral reefs and ones that have bleached as a result of warming oceans.</p>

<p><a href="http://underwaterearth.org/#page-1">Underwater Earth’s XL Catlin Seaview Survey</a> is making stunning panoramic images of coral reefs. Think of it as the oceanic version of Google Street View. With hundreds of thousands of photos taken already, the survey is globally documenting reef health and making the data it’s collecting along the way widely available to the public. Corals are declining one to two percent each year, so photographing this loss could help the world see what’s at stake.</p>
<p>Founded in 2010 by a group of former advertisers, Underwater Earth’s mission is to increase ocean literacy by taking captivating images of the world’s reefs. “Our goal was to collect ocean imagery to engage people in ways there weren’t possible before,” says Richard Vevers, Executive Director of the XL Catlin Seaview Survey and CEO of Underwater Earth.</p>
<p>People pause when they see these images–they understand that a white reef looks empty. Photos of ghostly white coral skeletons in American Samoa captured public attention earlier this year. The survey recorded a healthy reef there in December 2014 and then came back a few months later to document an extensively bleached one.</p>
<div id="attachment_20" style="width: 445px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/seasurvey.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20" class="wp-image-20" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/seasurvey-300x187.png" alt="seasurvey" width="435" height="271" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/seasurvey-300x187.png 300w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/seasurvey.png 643w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-20" class="wp-caption-text">Flowerpot Rocks, American Samoa, December 2014 (left) and February 2015 (right); (Photo credit: XL Catlin Seaview Survey)</p></div>
<p>“Oceans are like a veneer that provides us with life on earth. It’s oxygen, food, and weather–that’s why people need to understand the implications of ocean change,” says Vevers. Up to 80 percent of carbon dioxide could be absorbed by oceans, so they really are the focal point of climate change.</p>
<p>By working with Google, the largest online communicator, the photos are now the most viewed underwater images in history. Some have been viewed by millions of people after being linked to Google’s homepage. The survey has taken over 750,000 images in 26 countries, but Google hosts a smaller curation of the panoramas on <a href="http://www.google.com/maps/streetview/#oceans">Oceans Street View</a>.</p>
<p>“Google provides a platform for organizations like Underwater Earth, NOAA and Mission Blue, who know the stories and issues best, to use our technology to tell their story,” says Jenifer Austin, manager of Google’s Ocean Program.</p>
<p>The survey is funded by the specialty insurance group XL Catlin. It’s no surprise that insurance companies are paying close attention to the effects of climate change given the economic costs of more frequent and intense natural disasters.</p>
<p>[googlemaps https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m0!3m2!1sen!2sfr!4v1448384619751!6m8!1m7!1socgCD5dOU64AAAQo8A3lQQ!2m2!1d-14.2591333161759!2d-169.5003055184385!3f180.52024213220255!4f-11.97090933730766!5f0.4000000000000002&amp;w=600&amp;h=450]</p>
<p>To create each panoramic image, divers take a photo every two meters and can cover about 6 kilometers each day. Three images are taken simultaneously to get the 360 degree panoramic photos all while recording metadata like temperature, time, depth, and coordinates. Once the data is processed over the course of a few weeks, it can be uploaded to the Underwater Earth website using the <a href="http://www.google.com/maps/about/partners/businessview/apply/">Google Business photography program</a>.</p>
<p>They’re taking more than just pretty pictures, though. A technology similar to facial recognition systems that was developed by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography can assess the health of corals in each image. Without that technology, it could take a person months to go through as many images and it would be less precise than the 90 percent accuracy the recognition system has. What’s more is that all of the data collected about reef conditions is publicly <a href="http://globalreefrecord.org/data">available online</a>, so scientists can use it anytime.</p>
<p>Since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch program released its predictive bleaching tools this year, the survey has the ability to photograph a reef before and then after a major bleaching event. Coral Reef Watch sounds the alarm with its predictive maps up to months in advance and the survey goes in to take a firsthand look at the bleaching. Field scientists can then layer data about local conditions on these images to share information about what’s happening to the reef.</p>
<p>Closely watching these bleached reefs has scientific value too. By documenting resilient reefs with high recovery rates, scientists can show that reefs have a better chance of survival when human stressors are limited. Local managers can then use the images and data analysis to gain support for marine conservation.</p>
<p>“Better management and marine policy allows us to buy enough time for reefs to potentially repopulate and adapt. That’s the real reason we need measures in place to control local conditions,” says Vevers. “If we continue business as usual, we’ll lose most corals by 2050.”</p>
<p>What’s next for the CSS? For now they’re working on documenting all six coral reef regions in the world and then revisiting them every four to five years to see how they’re changing. If there’s a big storm, such as a major cyclone in the Great Barrier Barrier Reef, they’ll go assess the damage. Underwater robots might come somewhere down the line too.</p>
<p>Underwater Earth and Google are also working on more outreach. They’re setting up educational programs to take school children, media professionals, and stakeholders on virtual dives–places they might not otherwise see. The imagery is already being used in classrooms with <a href="https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/">Google Expeditions</a>.</p>
<p>“The potential of this partnership is huge. That a small non-profit partner could leverage our mapping technology to reach a large global audience and millions of people is unparalleled,” says Austin.</p>

<p>It’s clear Underwater Earth is raising public awareness about coral bleaching and the importance of reefs to livelihoods. And, partnering with Google has certainly furthered the reach of the project and might help lead to future policy changes too. To gain support for marine conservation, world leaders must be able to see what’s at risk if we don’t limit human stressors. Underwater Earth is providing the visuals to do just that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s a test. Try to list five reasons why the oceans are important to life on earth. It may get a bit difficult when you are down to reason number four or five. Now, describe how the things you just listed would be affected by CO<sub>2</sub> emissions caused by human activities. You may think that I am expecting too much from you. I am not. These facts are as important as knowing why water is essential to the world and how polluting it would affect us.</p>
<p>The global ocean is vast and so is the diversity of organisms that call it home. It covers 71% of the Earth’s surface, housing hundreds of thousands of species. In fact, it is essential for the survival of humans and other organisms on land as it is critical in regulating the earth’s climate to make it hospitable for us. Marine ecosystems also provide other essential goods and services such as food and coastal protection and are an integral component of my culture.</p>
<p>The oceans contribute tremendously to moderating the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on the climate, although this is achieved with great costs. In a recent paper published in <em>Science,</em> my colleagues and I summarized these benefits and costs. While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that the warming of the Earth’s surface is caused by human CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the global ocean has already done a tremendous service to us by absorbing 93% of the additional heat caused by these emissions since the 1970s. The ocean also has captured 28% of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted from our (and our ancestor’s) activities since 1750. Thus, without these moderating effects from the oceans, climate change would have been much more severe by now.</p>
<p>The absorption of heat and CO<sub>2</sub> substantially alters the physical and chemical properties of the oceans, which in turn has large effects on marine organisms. The heat warms up the ocean, reducing the amount of oxygen context, and the CO<sub>2</sub> acidifies the oceans. This combination can be deadly to marine life and affects us through decreases in fisheries catches and diversity of species, loss of tourism attractions such as diving and snorkeling, and increases in exposure to storms and other extreme events. In addition, as the ocean absorbs heat and CO<sub>2</sub>, its ability to moderate more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions actually reduces.</p>
<p>Many of the impacts of climate change on the oceans have already been recorded. Marine species ranging from plankton to fish, and marine mammals have shifted their distributions by tens to hundreds of kilometers per decade generally towards the poles, or to cooler waters, to find areas where they can survive as the ocean changes. Seasonality of biological events such as reproduction and migration are also altered. Ocean acidification has been shown to affect fish and shellfish from high latitudes to the tropics. These changes affect food web interactions between marine producers, grazers, and predators, creating new compositions of species that have not been seen in recent history. Additionally, marine biodiversity and ecosystems are already facing a multitude of threats from humans, including overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. These threats will add to, and even be exacerbated by, the impacts of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
<p>Today, sensitive and vulnerable ecosystems such as tropical coral reefs are taking the brunt of these impacts. Tropical coral reefs are particularly sensitive to the combination of CO<sub>2</sub> related stressors. Under heat stress, corals “bleach” by losing symbiotic algae that is essential for their survival. Ocean acidification makes it more difficult for corals to build calcium carbonate exoskeletons, making them amongst the most sensitive groups of organisms to ocean acidification. In some locations in the tropical oceans, such as in Papua New Guinea, CO<sub>2</sub> is naturally seeping out from the ground, providing a window for us to see what coral reefs ecosystem are like in a high CO<sub>2</sub> ocean. Coral reefs closer to these sites have substantially lower diversity of both corals and their associated species. Coral reefs provide critical habitats for tens of thousands of species. They are also important tourist attractions, and their fisheries are an important source of food and livelihood for coastal communities. Loss of coral reefs will thus threaten biodiversity, income, livelihood, and food security.</p>
<p>Fishermen’s catches in general are affected when distribution and abundance of the fish stocks shift. A study, conducted by colleagues and myself, analyzed the world’s marine fisheries catches since the 1970s. We developed an indicator to use fish catches as a “thermometer” that is based on the average temperature preferences of species in the fisheries catches. We found that the world’s catches have been increasingly dominated by warmer water species in the last four decades at a rate that is related to ocean warming, even after the effects of changes in fishing intensity have been accounted for.</p>
<p>The oceans will look substantially different in the future if we make different decisions on limitations of greenhouse gas emissions and ocean management. Under the “business-as-usual” scenario, and without major efforts in limiting emissions, temperatures in the surface layer of the ocean are expected to increase by 2.7<sup>o </sup>C from levels in the 1990s, and the ocean will acidify at a rate that is unprecedented over the past millions of years. Many marine organisms, from seagrass, coral reefs, and shellfish to fish and seabirds will be severely impacted. Fish stocks are projected to shift their distribution 65% faster towards the poles compared to a scenario in which we limit ocean warming below 1<sup>o </sup>C relative to the 1990s.</p>
<p>Climate change is expected to impact the tropical marine ecosystems the hardest, through a combination of loss of biodiversity, decreases in potential fisheries catches, sea level rises, and the inherent high dependence of many tropical countries and communities on marine ecosystems. The capacity to adapt to these impacts is relatively low. However, areas outside the tropics will not be safe from climate change impacts. Warming, ocean acidification, and the loss of sea ice are threatening polar ecosystems. Shifts in distribution of commercially important fish stocks are expected to lead to international fisheries conflicts. Some countries and communities may lose their traditionally or culturally important fisheries. In addition, given the globalized networks of seafood supply, decreases in catches in the tropics, of tuna, for example, will also impact markets far away from the sources.</p>
<p>Opportunities still exist that would allow us to substantially reduce these impacts. Limiting emissions to a less than 1<sup>o </sup>C warmth of the ocean going forward is necessary; otherwise, a substantially different ocean would result from any less-stringent emissions scenarios. Also, we need to implement all other measures to reduce the existing stresses on marine ecosystems, which will help reduce impacts from climate change. Efforts to rebuild ecosystems and biodiversity that have already been damaged (e.g., coral reefs) are needed. However, all these opportunities will disappear if we do not act quickly.</p>
<p>The ocean is a vital component of the Earth, supporting life in this planet and our own well-being. Any discussion about the sustainability of this planet, such as setting CO<sub>2</sub> emission limits or goals for sustainable development, must consider the oceans. Otherwise, such discussions will risk making inadequate decisions for the future of the planet.</p>
