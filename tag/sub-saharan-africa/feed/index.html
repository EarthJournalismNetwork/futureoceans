								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before Noavy started monitoring shark catches, she would only get up before dawn to harvest the seaweed that lies drying in various stages of rubbery or crispy tangles outside her home.</p>
<p>Nowadays, her data-collection on sharks being brought into her village means she&#8217;s up and on call at all hours, despite the fact that the animals have been rapidly disappearing from Madagascar&#8217;s shoreline for the past 30 years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before, there were big things in the sea. But now, it&#8217;s only sometimes,&#8221; she said from her hut in the village of Lamboara, home to a few hundred people on Madagascar&#8217;s south-west coast and marooned by afternoon lagoon tides.</p>
<p>Noavy is 46, but like many people in rural Madagascar, she doesn&#8217;t have a surname. She remembers being told not to go in the water as a teenager as the shallows were brimming with sharks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t go to wash ourselves because we were scared of them,&#8221; she recalls.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could see them from the beach,&#8221; and hear the stories of fishermen in <em>pirogues</em> &#8211; dug out canoes &#8211; mauled by sharks as they tried to reel in their catch, she adds.</p>
<p>But the fishermen up and down this overfished coast now have to paddle and sail for hours to find smaller sharks in the deeper waters, as the shores have been emptied.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/155511086" width="100%" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
It takes two hours of bumping down rocky tracks in a trolley-sized cart drawn by <em>zebu</em> &#8211; Madagascar&#8217;s beloved bulls &#8211; to reach Lamboara, and a few hours to sail the 15 kilometers back to reach a bigger village called Andavadoaka.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s there that British charity Blue Ventures has been working with local communities for a decade to set up Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs) with around 25 villages that have seen great success with octopus reserves that boost their numbers, and therefore people&#8217;s profits.</p>
<p>Now, the marine conservation organization is working with community members trained on how to record octopus and shark catches using mobile phones and tablets to better understand how local ecosystems work, and can be fished sustainably.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who live by the sea just think that the fish that have been there for centuries will just always be there, even though they&#8217;re decreasing&#8221;, says Roger Samba, president of the LMMA.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s vital that they have the tools to understand why fish stocks are falling, and how to control them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite invasive for a whole load of scientists to go into a village, and it&#8217;s a bit meaningless, whereas if you get a community to monitor resources and habit they&#8217;re fishing on it&#8217;s more meaningful for Blue Ventures but ultimately them&#8221;, says Tori Jeffers, who manages Blue Ventures&#8217; smartphone project. On a more local and immediate level, she hopes that data &#8220;fed back to community in an understandable manner&#8221; will help fuel decisions on shark fishing closures during pupping seasons or around breeding areas. The aim is not only to find out what and how much is being caught, by who and where, but to get faster, more accurate data that can be shared and analyzed on open data platforms.</p>
<p>An estimated 100 million sharks are caught globally per year and a quarter of shark and ray species are threatened with extinction.</p>
<p>But conservationists think that up to 40 percent might be endangered as so little is known about the sea&#8217;s vital predators that police the oceans&#8217; reefs.</p>
<p>Shark export records in Madagascar date back to the 1920s, but nowadays, despite agreements with foreign fleets allowed to fish for shark or have them in bycatch, there is very little monitoring along the 6,500 kilometer-long coastline.</p>
<p>And with severely-underfunded government patrols unable to purchase even the petrol for their boats, conservation has to start in the communities whose livelihoods depend on the oceans and see the future value of recording data.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like the phone as I can save everything; nothing gets lost,&#8221; says Noavy, who before might lose the data on a pen and pad or forget which fisherman had caught what.</p>
<p>It took a while for anyone to call Noavy to tell her that they&#8217;d caught a shark, as they were suspicious about their details being noted down or put into a smartphone.</p>
<p>Through Blue Ventures, she is able to pay them 300 ariary ($0.10) per shark as compensation for waiting while she does her work, &#8220;so now they see the benefit,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>She starts by measuring the length of the shark, photographing its body, head and mouth to make sure that fishermen don&#8217;t try to claim the same shark twice. She then determines and records its sex and entering the details of where and when it was caught.</p>
<p>In the three years she&#8217;s been recording details &#8211; first on paper, now a smartphone that she charges using a solar panel on her thatched roof &#8211; she&#8217;s noticed the general trend of sharks getting smaller and fewer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to find so many types of sharks, and now not many,&#8221; she says. Some species like the white shark, tiger shark and fresh water sharks have completely vanished from Lamboara&#8217;s nets.</p>
<p>In addition to the monitoring of sharks, fishermen have also started seeing the benefit of having information on what they catch for octopus, which have a short life and breeding span.</p>

<p>At the start, there was strong opposition to the idea of octopus closures. Many people with little faith in politicians and foreigners thought it was a trick to plunder their catch, rather than an effort to allow octopus stocks to rise. It was only later when the catches were shown to have improved that people embraced the idea and expanded it to over 20 neighboring villages.</p>
<p>&#8220;This kind of model that you apply and then have the opinion of the community is very important,” says Tinah Voahangy Martin, Blue Ventures&#8217; Fisheries Programme Assistant. “Conservation alone won&#8217;t change anything, because if people are told just to protect these resources, what are they going to do for their own living?&#8221;</p>
<p>60-year-old shark hunter Jean-Francois says that sharks were so big in the 1980s that fishermen would sometimes have to fill their <em>pirogues</em> with water &#8211; almost sinking them &#8211; so that they could get them on board to bring home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to catch so many sharks, but now it&#8217;s so difficult,&#8221; he says, before showing the jawbone of a shark that he proudly caught last month that produced 80 kilos of meat.</p>

<p>Just twenty or thirty years ago, the whole village would celebrate when a shark was brought in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone who wanted to eat would come and take some. But now, no one shares their sharks, as before life was much easier and slower and no one was here to buy this cheap meat. Now everyone wants it,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Asia&#8217;s 1980s economic boom sparked a global shark market that peaked in the mid-1990s, with shark fin soup seen as a luxury item.</p>
<p>The fin market is now worth up to $500 million per year, and while increasing awareness of the shark-finning process is turning many people off, the taste for shark meat is increasing, as is the use of shark liver oil for biomedical purposes.</p>
<p>Industrial shark fishing in Madagascar&#8217;s Economic Export Zone (EEZ) really took off in the 1990s. Some European and Asian boats have public agreements with the Malagasy government and some have private agreements. It&#8217;s hard to tell which boats are above board, and whether or not they&#8217;re sticking to their quotas.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many boats that come at night and by morning they&#8217;re gone. We just see the lights. There&#8217;s a lot of illegal fishing,&#8221; says Samba.</p>

<p>Local fishers complain about industrial fishing boats encroaching on their business with bigger and better equipment that allows them to sweep up many big fish further out.</p>
<p>&#8220;So many sharks want to come here, but they catch them,&#8221; says Jean-Francois.</p>
<p>&#8220;I often see the big boats, and if I don&#8217;t see them, every day I hear them,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>But overfishing by locals means that the shorelines are no longer a refuge for sharks. It took Blue Ventures some time to explain that sharks played an important role as “policemen of the sea” controlling other species and ecosystems before people understood their worth in the water.</p>
<p>On the tiny and barren island of Andragnambala, there are no schools or clinics, just a cluster of huts housing around 160 people – all of whom depend solely on fishing to survive.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t earn from fish here, you&#8217;d suffer miserably,&#8221; says shark monitor Lydia Lamy, whose husband has just pulled in a shark that turns out to be pregnant with six well-formed pups. The catch will net him the equivalent of $2.50.</p>
<p>Only a handful of people here have been to school, but the community knows that killing pregnant sharks is a bad idea.</p>
<p>And the men here know that the more fibrous a shark fin, the more they will get paid from collectors that make the 12 kilometer trip from the mainland.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine what they want with the fins, but I know that they want the fibers,&#8221; says Aim<span class="_Tgc">é</span>, a fisherman who has just pulled in a hammerhead shark &#8211; an endangered species &#8211; for the price of around 25,000 ariary, or $5.</p>
<p>Blue Ventures is slowly teaching people about the role of sharks in keeping other fish stocks healthy. They hope that the open data kit form might be used across Madagascar and beyond to shine a light on what&#8217;s happening in the blue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lydia and Noavy are among 13 data collectors in eight villages that are trying to spread an important conservationist message: only by knowing what you have in the sea, can you protect it for future generations.</p>
<p>Like many along Lamboara&#8217;s coast, they would prefer to return to days when they were scared to let their children bathe in shallow waters full of pupping sharks, rather that live in a world without them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to protect sharks for our children’s future,” says 60-year-old fisherman Jean-Francois. “If we just keep catching them there will be nothing left.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Will there be a day when the seafood on your plate has been certified as sustainable, toxin-free and exploitation-free and has been tracked from the time it was hooked to the time it is purchased? Will this information be verified by satellites from the sky that have cross-referenced errant transmissions and have correlated them with reports from an at-sea observer? Will every flag-state inspect the fishing vessels under their jurisdiction for compliance with international regulations to prove clean ownership, transparent operations and vessel seaworthiness? Will conservation, followed by technology and innovation be the prime motivators within the fishing industry thereby reducing wastage and promoting conservation?</p>
<p>Today we are a long way from being able to answer even one of these questions in the affirmative, exposing the vast divide between the principles of the conventions being ratified at the United Nations and the practicality in achieving their goals. Why it is so hard – if not impossible – to achieve a positive response to all those questions? The case of one particular fishing vessel provides some clues.</p>
<div id="attachment_542" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/seashepherd.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-542" class="size-full wp-image-542" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/seashepherd.jpg" alt="The Atlas Cove, Bob Barker and Sam Simon, in pursuit of the poaching vessel, Thunder.

<p>Fishing in the Southern Ocean is regulated by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), one of the seventeen Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) that regulate fishing in various ocean regions across the world. In short, the RFMO consists of interested member countries that flag and operate vessels that fish under the conditions of RFMO permits and report back to ensure a complete feedback system is in place.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, a global market began to develop for Chilean Seabass and there was a rush to fish the rich waters of the Southern Ocean. By the mid-1990s, the illegal catch of Chilean Seabass outweighed those caught legally under CCAMLR, or under national jurisdiction. Strict actions were quickly taken under the CCAMLR to stamp out a bulk of the unsanctioned activity, but six vessels took advantage of legal loopholes and continued to illegally fish inside the controlled waters of the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>The <em>Thunder</em> was one such vessel. She had largely employed some, or all, of the measures listed below to remain beyond the full reach of the current law:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using Flags of Non Compliance: Flagging ships to non-member countries and thereby attaining the status of “Unregulated.” The <em>Thunder</em> flew the flags of Togo, Mongolia, Seychelles, Belize and Nigeria, none of them members of the CCAMLR.</li>
<li>Fishing in the high seas: Fishing in regions where no internationally binding laws apply and therefore acting outside the enforcement regime of the RFMO member-countries. Between 2006 and 2014, the <em>Thunder</em> was sighted a total of eighteen times. She was either fishing in or transiting through the high seas region of the CCAMLR management region.</li>
<li>Calling ports with relaxed enforcement regimes: Landing catch at ports with very relaxed port state controls in South East Asia and Africa, thus ensuring that the vessels are not inspected when landing their catch, while at the same time accessing port facilities to refuel, re-stock and change crew. The <em>Thunder </em>called ports in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Mauritius over the years. She was inspected in Malaysia in 2013 and was found to have on board a cargo of illegally caught Patagonian toothfish. The captain and crew of the <em>Thunder</em> were fined $AU90,000 &#8211; only a fraction of the $US60 million that Interpol estimated that ship’s owners have earned from the vessel’s illegal catch since 2006. Having paid the fine, the crew and ship were later released along with their illegal catch, and they subsequently returned to the Southern Ocean.</li>
<li>Employing additional techniques: Using the invisibility in the oceans to hide the true identity of the vessel by forging documents, hopping flags, changing names and operating under shell companies thereby hiding beneficial ownership. The <em>Thunder</em> swapped names between <em>Rubin, Typhoon I, Kuko, Wuhan No. 4, Ming No. 5</em><em>, </em>and over the years changed ownership at least seven times.</li>
</ol>

<p>Today the <em>Thunder</em> does not exist. She was found fishing illegally within the high seas of the Southern Ocean on December 17, 2014 by the marine conservation group, Sea Shepherd. Operating under the UN World Charter for Nature, Sea Shepherd is well known for its direct-action approach to conservation. With the mandate to uphold international conservation law, Sea Shepherd intervenes to stop environmental crimes that impact the marine environment, in situations where those responsible for law enforcement are unable to, or refuse to, uphold those laws.</p>
<p>Over the next 109 days, the <em>Thunder</em> remained on the high seas, traveling a distance of 10,000 nautical miles from the Southern Ocean to the Indian Ocean and round the Cape of Good Hope to the South Atlantic Ocean, effectively remaining outside the reach of the world’s navies. She moved freely despite being subject to a Purple Notice by Interpol and a reputation for being the world’s most notorious poacher. In early April 2015, the vessel was deliberately sunk by her captain in the waters of São Tomé and Príncipe, a tiny West African island country.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ71Y_g116A&amp;w=560&amp;h=315" height="315" width="100%"></iframe></p>
<p><em>The</em> <em>Thunder</em> case study presents three distinct facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Illegal vessels do not hide behind a shroud of secrecy. In fact they exist because they remain beyond the full reach of the law.</li>
<li>The illegality within the fishing industry exists because of the maze of countries involved, most often with outdated legal instruments to keep pace with the current industry and a non-harmonization of regulations.</li>
<li>A woeful lack of enforcement and in proactive patrols exists on the world’s oceans. During a recent address in Chile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry sighted the case of the <em>Thunder</em> and commented that, “there are millions of square miles of oceans that are unregulated and that you have unscrupulous people who are chasing the money.” He further added, “The responsibility of pursuing pirate ships cannot be left to environmental groups,” highlighting a need for consensus on greater enforcement mechanisms.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <em>Thunder</em> case study highlights the importance of at-sea patrols. To achieve true marine conservation, the world needs an ocean governed by laws that can be monitored and enforced. Until lofty principles can be practicably enforced and the questions posed at the beginning of this article be affirmatively answered, on-the-scene enforcement, which stops crimes as they are taking place, remains the most effective tool to target illegal activity on the world’s oceans. And while regulatory grey areas, a lack of resources, and a lack of government will continue to plague maritime law, leading to ineffective enforcement on the high seas, organisations such as Sea Shepherd will continue to play a vital role filling this law enforcement gap.</p>
<p>Consequences for non-compliance must be swift and binding, as it is not the scale of the punishment, but the certainty of it that acts as the biggest deterrent to crime. Currently, the vastness of the high seas and overlaps and gaps between regional and international jurisdictional responsibilities remain a challenge to marine law enforcement. However, recent moves towards international cooperation on fisheries crimes indicate that momentum is building to tackle the challenges, head-on.</p>
