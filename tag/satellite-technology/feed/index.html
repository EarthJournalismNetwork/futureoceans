								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Easter Island is best known for its mysterious Moai statues, which dominate part of the hilly coastline and stare at the horizon like ancient watchmen of the once bountiful ocean. Just beyond the reach of their gaze lies a large stretch of open water, known as the high seas, that provides a vital spawning ground for many overfished and highly migratory species, including tuna and sharks.</p>
<p>The seas were once plentiful, notes Alberto Hotus, president of the Easter Island Elder’s Council, who fondly remembers when a fishing boat could easily bring back enough to feed the whole island. “[This] does not happen anymore,” he says with a hint of sadness. “There are no tuna, no fish.”</p>
<p>Residents of the island, also known as Rapa Nui, have long claimed that vessels are fishing illegally in their waters. Many local fishermen attest to seeing the distant glimmer of foreign vessel lights at night.</p>
<p>“People on the island have been complaining about illegal fishing for years,” says Marta Hotus, the governor of Easter Island. Evidence of these activities, such as buoys and long nets—fishing gear that is not used by the locals—even regularly washed ashore.</p>
<p>The Rapa Nui people once used their celestial-based navigation skills to “conquer the islands by navigating across the seas,” says Mayor Pedro Pablo Edmunds Paoa. He describes them as the “Phoenicians of the Pacific,” referring to the ancient Mediterranean civilization renown for having mastered deep-sea navigation, covering great distances in their ships of trade and war.</p>
<div id="attachment_579" style="width: 4010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/8597886315_182f1aeef7_o.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-579" class="size-full wp-image-579" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/8597886315_182f1aeef7_o.jpg" alt="Moai statues keep watch on Easter Island (Credit: Flickr/David Berkowitz)" width="4000" height="3000" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/8597886315_182f1aeef7_o.jpg 4000w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/8597886315_182f1aeef7_o-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/8597886315_182f1aeef7_o-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/8597886315_182f1aeef7_o-1020x765.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-579" class="wp-caption-text">Moai statues keep watch on Easter Island (Credit: Flickr/David Berkowitz)</p></div>
<p>But the illustrious navigational past of the Rapa Nui alone is no match for the industrial scale of illegal fishing operations. Nor can it reverse the impact on the livelihoods of a community whose very survival has long been tied to the ocean’s bounty.</p>
<p>“What I see in the sea makes me sad because I see fishermen go out and come back with nothing,” says Sara Roe, president of the Hanga Piko fishing association on Easter Island. “Coming back with nothing means that they won’t have bread for their kids, there will be no food for the household, so that is a problem for the people.”</p>
<p>The case of Easter Island partly demonstrates the difficulties faced by governments in monitoring remote areas of the high seas, which in turn become fertile ground for illegal fishing operations. Governments around the world have recognized the scale of the problem and are seeking solutions, but their resources vary enormously.</p>
<p>What role can advances in technology play in putting an end to illegal activities on the high seas that pillage an estimated $23.5 billion worth of fish each year? Because, let’s face it &#8211; trying to look for illegal fishing activities taking place across an area covering half the planet is akin to looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>The answer, some companies say, is by monitoring the seas from the sky.</p>
<p>Stuart Martin, CEO of the U.K.-based firm Satellite Applications Catapult, says that satellite data is now playing a “key role” in helping to end illegal fishing activities. It’s also helping to make the protection of livelihoods in many villages a “reality rather than an idealistic goal.”</p>
<p>John Amos, president of the U.S. non-profit group SkyTruth, agrees. Satellite data and real-time vessel tracking, he says, is “evolving quickly” and “shining a light on the commercial fleet that has been operating largely out of sight since humans first sailed over the horizon.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_534" style="width: 1926px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-534" class="size-full wp-image-534" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult.png" alt="Catapult keeps an eye on the seas" width="1916" height="1006" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult.png 1916w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult-300x158.png 300w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult-1020x536.png 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 1916px) 100vw, 1916px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-534" class="wp-caption-text">Catapult keeps an eye on the seas (Credit: Catapult)</p></div>
<h2><strong>Out of sight, out of mind </strong></h2>
<p>Located some 4,000 kilometers (2,300 miles) west of Chile, Easter Island’s isolated location coupled with the vast size of its surrounding ocean makes it vulnerable to illegal fishing—a criminal activity taking place on a global scale, fueled in part by the assumption that no one is watching. With the advent of more affordable space-based satellite technologies and their pioneering integration into custom monitoring platforms, there are more eyes than ever on the sea.</p>
<p>“The big change in the last few years that will accelerate into the future is the reduced costs of launching and developing highly effective satellites. As the number and usefulness of satellites increases, more data is available for effective monitoring,” explains Brad Soule, Senior Fisheries Analyst at Catapult’s Ocean Sustainability Business Unit.</p>
<p>As the Rapa Nui community became increasingly concerned with threats to their ocean environment, so did conservation groups, who sought an innovative way to answer their call for greater protection. SkyTruth, an organization that specializes in satellite-based remote sensing technologies, was soon enlisted by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Bertarelli Foundation to monitor and identify the best ways to protect the island’s waters.</p>
<p>The information compiled as part of the project prompted the Chilean Navy to increase its patrol efforts of the province. Likewise, in late 2015, the findings contributed to the announcement of a 631,368 square kilometers (243,630 square miles) marine park around the area, now considered to be the third-largest fully protected area of ocean in the world.</p>
<p>“In early 2012, Pew contacted us to ask if it was possible to monitor the activity of ships – including fishing vessels – in the waters of Easter Island Province,” said John Amos, an expert in using satellite images, aerial photographs and other kinds of remote sensing and digital mapping.</p>
<p>He had founded SkyTruth in 2001.</p>
<p>In January 2013, they began a monitoring program that used satellite radar images to detect the presence of ships, and satellite-collected Automatic Identification System (AIS) broadcasts to identify those vessels. At the time, this was the first instance of these two different technologies being combined in this way to monitor a country’s waters for illegal fishing activity.</p>
<div id="attachment_610" style="width: 5197px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/6684136035_dd559925f6_o.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-610" class="size-full wp-image-610" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/6684136035_dd559925f6_o.jpg" alt="Moai statue sits near a small harbor on Easter Island (Credit: Flickr/Ronald Woan)" width="5187" height="3458" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/6684136035_dd559925f6_o.jpg 5187w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/6684136035_dd559925f6_o-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/6684136035_dd559925f6_o-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/6684136035_dd559925f6_o-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/6684136035_dd559925f6_o-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 5187px) 100vw, 5187px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-610" class="wp-caption-text">Moai statue sits near a small harbor on Easter Island (Credit: Flickr/Ronald Woan)</p></div>
<p>Data collected between January and October 2013, including 163 satellite images, detected 73 vessels in and around Easter Island’s waters. Of these, 31 were identified using AIS (to include 22 cargo ships, 5 fishing vessels, 1 cruise ship, and 3 undefined). More than half (the remaining 42 vessels) could not be identified using their AIS broadcasts, but based on their size and location were determined by SkyTruth to be commercial fishing vessels. More than half of those vessels (a total of 25) were detected within Easter Island’s Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>
<h2><strong>Knowing where to look</strong></h2>
<p>“To stop illegal fishing and other crimes taking place on the ocean, authorities first need to be able to recognize and track vessels,” argues Pew’s Tony Long in his article “Satellite Tracking Can Unmask Illegal Fishing Vessels.” The former British naval commander now directs the organization’s <em>Ending Illegal Fishing Project.</em></p>
<p>Unlike mobile phones or cars, fishing vessels are not required to have an identification number. This means that identifying vessels at sea is not a straightforward exercise and requires the integration of differing but complimentary tools into a monitoring platform.</p>
<p>So how does it work?</p>
<p>The monitoring project conducted off Easter Island, for example, pioneered the combined use of two key tools—radar imagery and the Automatic Identification System (AIS)—to track and identify vessels.</p>
<p>Radar satellites can identify ships by beaming microwave (radar) energy down at the Earth’s surface and collecting the energy that is reflected back toward the satellite. According to SkyTruth’s Amos, steel-hulled ships are “strong reflectors of microwave energy and appear as very bright targets or radar images of the ocean.”</p>
<p>This allows for the observation of vessel activities without their participation or knowledge, an especially vital tool for ships that deliberately switch off their transceivers in order to avoid detection or don’t have them installed.</p>
<p>These radar images can yield basic information, including the exact location of a vessel at the moment the image was acquired, its approximate size and in some cases, the direction it’s moving. “But there is little information in a radar image that allows us to identify the vessel, or determine if it’s a fishing vessel rather than a cargo ship or other type of ship,” says Amos.</p>

<p>To fill the gap, SkyTruth combined radar satellite imagery with a second monitoring component known as a satellite-collected Automatic Identification System (AIS)—a form of automatic transceiver similar to a global positioning system (GPS) that is broadcast by vessels. Unlike other transceivers, such as the government-controlled Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), AIS was not designed for monitoring purposes. Instead it’s primarily used to prevent vessels from colliding at sea.</p>
<p>The use of AIS transceivers, however, is a relatively new approach in the fight against illegal fishing. “I think that AIS has only recently started to be used because it was not designed for fisheries monitoring purposes,” says Brad Soule from Catapult, adding that the number of satellites available for monitoring AIS do make it a useful tool for other maritime domain awareness purposes as long as you “account for some of the security issues that have already been addressed in traditional vessel monitoring systems.”</p>
<p>Collecting the AIS data was only the first step towards building a more accurate picture of the types of activities and behavioral patterns of vessels in Easter Island waters, as it’s the actual correlation and overlaying of data sources which facilitates the identification of vessel types.</p>
<h2><strong>Tracking vessels that don’t want to be tracked</strong></h2>
<p>Despite huge advances in satellite monitoring technology, “it can still be rigged to fool its users, and AIS and VMS are no different,” states Tony Long from Pew. Effective use of vessel tracking systems to detect illegal fishing activities therefore requires an understanding of how vessels circumvent the system in order to go unnoticed. Moreover, it’s vital that users have a thorough understanding of the differing behavior patterns and movements between cargo vessels and fishing vessels when monitoring their tracks on a screen.</p>
<p>Off the coast of Easter Island, SkyTruth collected AIS data that revealed distinct patterns of vessel movement and enabled the detection of suspected illegal activity. For example, vessels that move very slowly and frequently change directions are typically engaged in fishing activities, whereas those moving in straight lines at a steady speed are more likely to be cargo ships moving between South America and Asia.</p>
<p>Vessels that aren’t broadcasting AIS signals could be deliberating switching them off to avoid detection, but Amos says that this lack of signal could also result from gaps in orbiting satellite coverage.</p>
<p>To ensure continued monitoring coverage, SkyTruth regularly collected radar satellite imagery to see if any vessels appeared to be operating in Easter Island waters that were not broadcasting an AIS signal. “In many cases,” says Amos, “we could not find any AIS signals for vessels that appeared on the satellite imagery.”</p>
<p>So who were these vessels?</p>
<p>Amos calls them the <em>dark fleet</em>: vessels that “operate in stealth by not publicly broadcasting their identity.” In other words, vessels likely to be carrying out illegal fishing activities.</p>
<p>“In the remote waters of Easter Island,” Amos says, “we can assume a vessel larger than 20 meters that is not broadcasting AIS is probably a commercial fishing vessel.”</p>

<h2><strong>Keeping one step ahead</strong></h2>
<p>As demonstrated by the Skytruth study—where over half of the vessels monitored did not transmit an AIS signal—illegal fishing vessels are increasingly aware that they are being monitored through their safety and anti-vessel collision transceiver.</p>
<p>Even transceivers which are designed for monitoring purposes, such as the government enforced Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), face the challenge of having the devices tampered with once installed. VMS is not applied universally and the mandatory ping rate varies per country, with most setting it at every 1- 2 hours. Experts recommend a ping rate of multiple times per hour in order to capture 100% of fishing locations.</p>
<p>With illegal fishing operations increasingly becoming aware of how the current traditional monitoring systems can be fooled, how reliable is the data being generated for analysts?</p>
<p>“It’s a good question and an important one,” says Soule from Catapult.</p>
<p>“AIS was never designed for fisheries and marine reserve monitoring. It is only recently that it has become a useful tool by virtue of the growth in the number of fishermen who want to demonstrate transparency and compliance in their operations. But you are right, by itself AIS is not a panacea without an understanding of the vessels’ identities and thereby likely activities in the context of the area of operation and specific jurisdictions.”</p>
<p>Adding information from another transceiver is one way to help build a more accurate picture.</p>
<p>“We also use vessel monitoring system (VMS) data, when it is made available, to monitor the activities of fishing vessels,” says Soule. One of the marked differences between AIS and VMS, is that the latter can be required by governments or vessel owners and do not broadcast positions publicly.</p>
<p>An experienced fisherman from a North African country explained that one way around collecting more accurate VMS data would be for governments to require vessels to have their systems on two weeks before the fishing season begins. This would “allow for better control, ahead of season” and provide a better understanding of that vessel’s behavior patterns.</p>
<p>Beyond the use of positional data relayed by transceivers to monitor specific areas, the addition of a variety of sensors, “including satellite radar and optical imagery” is also a key data component to detect the presence of vessels, explains Soule.</p>
<p>This year, the U.S. government plans to further develop an application to assist in detecting ocean vessels in countries including Indonesia and the Philippines, using the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), another form of space-based sensor. VIIRS is capable of detecting lights—including from boats that use lights to attract fishery catch at night—in order to target potentially illegal activities.</p>
<p>Advances are also being made in the speed at which the merging of data is being processed, which is a huge step forward in providing real time coverage of remote areas, especially when working in tandem with authorities who can deploy patrols to carry out further investigations.</p>
<p>“Previously it took a team of analysts 18 hours or more to analyze the data and be able to find a vessel of interest. This system brings together all of those datasets in less than 18 milliseconds,” explains Nick Wise, head of Catapult’s Ocean Sustainability business unit.</p>
<p>The new system in question is the recently launched Project Eyes on the Sea, a maritime monitoring and surveillance data platform that was developed in partnership with Catapult and the Pew Charitable Trusts.</p>
<div id="attachment_533" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-533" class="size-full wp-image-533" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room.jpg" alt="Catapult operation room (Credit: Jennifer Gillam)" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room.jpg 900w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-533" class="wp-caption-text">Catapult operation room (Credit: Jennifer Gillam)</p></div>
<p>This platform uses and merges multiple sets of data, including Vessel Monitoring Data (government collected data), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, optical imaging as well as AIS, and has been designed to enable enforcement efforts to focus on specific problem areas and vessels, cutting in time and money.</p>
<p>“We consider anything that provides a position, an identity, and some behavioral information—or any combination of these, and bring together many data sources that don’t usually exist in the same system,” explains Soule, adding that the system enables an analyst to “know where to look next.”</p>
<p>In the future, it will be able to merge and incorporate other sources of information third-party surveillance and crowd-sourced images that could originate from any person, ship, aircraft, or unmanned vehicle. Despite recent technological advances in monitoring, the high seas—an area representing two-thirds of the world’s ocean—remain notoriously difficult to monitor and patrol for illegal fishing activities. Less than one percent of the open ocean is accorded protection.</p>
<p>“At the moment, the high seas are the weakest link because of their poor management and lack of governance,” explains Professor Alex Rogers of Somerville College, Oxford.</p>
<h2><strong>Future ocean surveillance: What’s on the horizon? </strong></h2>
<p>Advanced technologies, remote surveillance tools, and satellite monitoring of the high seas have long been accessible to the military, as well as (though to a much lesser degree) governments, fisheries management agencies, and private companies such as international couriers. Since 2013, however, an important shift has taken place towards increasing access to satellite data, and also understanding the gaps in data which allow for illegal vessels to circumvent whatever moderate level of monitoring was taking place to avoid detection.</p>
<p>However, for all the progress made, satellite-based technological advances alone cannot be relied upon to curb illegal fishing or monitor newly protected areas on the high seas.</p>
<p>Nor is space-based monitoring not without its own evolutionary problems, as it “requires significant computational horsepower to bring the data together and compare the different sources to identify abnormalities,” according to Soule.</p>
<p>Satellite-based technological advances greatly reduce the human power needed to process vast quantities of data and are likely to become fully integrated into monitoring platforms ten years from now. As satellite coverage of transceivers expands and more and more governments require vessels to install them, however, they are unlikely to be relied upon alone.</p>
<p>Vessel ID registration is still not mandatory in all regions, which means that unlike traffic offenses on a speed camera, it will take some time before we have a global or even regional database linking a vessel’s ID to a tracking system, although huge progress is being made in national waters.</p>
<p>In the future, illegal fishing practices may also be curbed by the universal and mandatory application of electronically tracking fish at points of catch and sale, a regulation that an increasing amount of regional fisheries organizations are moving towards. In the long run, this is likely to shrink the market for illegal catches.</p>
<p>Today, on-site enforcement action and regular patrols in the air, at sea, and in ports, coupled with prosecution for crimes committed remain vital components in the global fight against illegal fishing.</p>
<p>Twenty years from now, however, if autonomous anti-collision drone technology continues to evolve at the predicted rate, future high-seas satellite monitoring platforms are likely to integrate this aerial surveillance tool not only as a key monitoring feature, but also one that expedites enforcement.</p>
<p>The current reality, however, is that policing remote areas of the open ocean is left in most instances to governments who have neither the means nor the human resources to properly enforce existing regulations in such remote locations. Overcoming such challenges may well require the increased use of satellite and autonomous aerial surveillance technologies &#8212; bridgingthe gap between sea and sky in a very modern way.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists in South Africa are using ocean robots to study the unexpected and complex interplay between the Southern Ocean and the Earth’s changing climate.</p>
<p>The researchers have been inspired by the fact that this is the least studied part of the planet and yet one of the most dynamic and difficult to understand. It’s also an area of high species abundance and diversity, where common and highly specialized species both thrive.</p>
<p>The Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observatory (SOCCO) research team under the South Africa’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has been using robotics to observe the upper ocean’s physical processes and study their impacts on carbon dioxide exchange between the atmosphere and ocean, as well as on the growth of phytoplankton – microscopic algae that live in the surface ocean.</p>
<p>Local experts say these cutting-edge robotic gliders will shape the future of marine research and environmental monitoring of the Southern Ocean and South African waters. They hope that the data they gather will reveal how human activity is changing the planet.</p>
<p>What is known, SOCCO researchers say, is that the Southern Ocean accounts for fifty percent of all carbon dioxide absorbed by the oceans. This part of the world’s ocean is particularly sensitive to climate change because the creatures living here are susceptible to minor environmental shifts, which can lead to large changes in global ocean currents or ecosystem health.</p>

<p>“Our one research gap that we hope to address with these gliders, in conjunction with satellites and computer models, is better understanding the role of small scale features (such as ocean eddies and currents) and short term events (storms) on the overall state of the ocean,” says Dr. Sebastian Swart, CSIR’s principal scientist.</p>
<p>“Before glider technology was available, we were unable to measure these forms of features and variability – research ships and satellite data alone were not enough to investigate this,” he says.</p>
<h2><strong>Diving new depths</strong></h2>
<p>The first Southern Ocean glider deployments began in September 2012 near the remote Gough Island, about 2000 kilometres south west of Cape Town. For six months, gliders collected and sent data back from one of the world’s harshest environments directly to scientists at CSIR.</p>
<p>Operators based in South Africa used satellite communications to remotely control the location and depth of the robots. Since then, additional long-endurance robotics experiments have taken place in the Southern Ocean on an annual basis.</p>
<p>“Enhancing our understanding of how the Southern Ocean works and interacts with climate today will leave us in a position to better mitigate against the effects of climate change tomorrow,” says Swart.</p>
<p>The robotic glider fleet currently has nine units in total – a number that is expected to increase with the growing need of the global research community for reliable data collecting platforms that can withstand these inhospitable ocean environments. Four are surface wave gliders, which ride the ocean surface measuring CO₂, acidity, and other physical variables of the surface ocean. The other five are profiling gliders that can dive to a maximum depth of one kilometre below the ocean surface.</p>

<p>During each deployment, the gliders “tweet” data via satellite to scientists in Cape Town where it is stored, analysed and eventually made available to the global research community.</p>
<p>According to Swart, CSIR researchers are able to combine the analysis of data from surface wave and profiling gliders by pairing them together while deployed in the ocean to give a complete picture of changes in the water.</p>
<h2><strong>Tailor-made technology </strong></h2>
<p>The gliders are maintained in Cape Town at the CSIR-led South Africa Marine Engineering and Robotics Centre (SAMERC) in partnership with a marine technology company called Sea Technology Services.</p>
<p>Manufactured in the US, the gliders are modified to suit local needs when they get to South Africa.</p>
<p>“This includes adding new sensors, building new sensors for gliders and ships, refurbishing and maintaining the gliders,” says Swart who has been deeply involved in building the robotic ocean glider program in South Africa.</p>
<p>Swart says a team of South African marine engineers and engineering students at SAMERC have been trained to use the ocean gliders – a unique and advanced skill that can be expanded across the rest of the continent. A string of development programs have already been lined up. Each year young black South African engineers are trained on this advanced ocean technology, particularly the use of robots and scientific sensors. More importantly, Swart says, young marine scientists are graduating from the country’s universities.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Swart’s current team, the gliders have been instrumental in measuring ocean hydrography, chemistry and optics.</p>
<p>“More specifically they measure CO₂ exchange between the ocean and atmosphere as well as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, light levels, bio-optical properties of the water and weather such as wind, air temperature and humidity,” Swart says.</p>
<p>The gliders are sent out to collect more data from the severe Southern Ocean environment each year.</p>
<p>“We are just beginning our fourth significant Southern Ocean robotics experiment,” says Swart revealing that the research is designed to observe the full seasonal cycle of the upper ocean and its physical-biological processes.</p>
<p>Four gliders were recently deployed from the <em>SA Agulhas II</em>, South Africa’s Antarctic research vessel, in the frigid and stormy winter sea.</p>
<p>“We hope these gliders will continue making measurements until late summer time in 2016 or approximately a year in total,” he says. “They provide measurements that can be used to improve models and forecasts of the oceans and weather.”</p>
<p>Swart’s team has also conducted experiments offshore of Port Elizabeth – the site of a strong current along South Africa’s east coast. Led by CSIR’s Dr. Marjolaine Krug in April 2015, the six-week project showed that it was possible, but challenging, for the gliders to navigate and collect data in areas dominated by strong currents.</p>
<h2><strong>Boosting ocean research</strong></h2>
<p>At the University of Cape Town’s Nansen-Tutu Centre for Marine Environmental Research (MARE), research and development in ocean prediction, and using measurements of the oceans from satellites, is done.</p>
<p>Dr. Björn Backeberg, oceanographic researcher and co-director of the Nansen-Tutu Centre says that in order to predict ocean currents, ocean models must be combined with ocean observations in order to limit model errors at the nowcast stage (i.e. today), providing a better estimate of the ocean state.</p>
<p>“Ocean prediction is an initial condition problem, so if we can improve our ocean state estimate at the nowcast stage, then we improve our forecast skill for tomorrow, the day after and next week,” he says.</p>
<p>The data collected from satellites controls ocean models in a process called data assimilation, Backeberg says, satellites only measure the ocean surface, thus information about the ocean interior is missing.</p>
<p>He says that to obtain measurements of the ocean interior, researchers have historically relied on measurements gathered by ships, but this form of data collection is incredibly expensive due to the large running costs of the ships.</p>
<p>To hire the research vessel<em>, SA Agulhas II</em>, it costs approximately 300,000 rand (over 23,000 USD) a day. The daily rate for a deployed glider instead is far less – about 3,000 rand (approximately 232 USD).</p>

<p>“Robots, or autonomous platforms, such as gliders and Argo profiling floats are a much more cost effective way of collecting data, especially in remote regions that have severe weather and ocean conditions, such as the Southern Ocean,” he says.</p>
<p>Backeberg says robots are able to collect high resolution information for periods up to six months, depending on battery power, and can provide consistent data throughout the year. Keeping a ship at sea for three months is comparatively much more expensive and observations were generally more sporadic in both space and time.</p>
<p>“Assimilating these types of observations in ocean models as well as using them to validate our ocean model will help improve our ability to predict the oceans more accurately,” he adds.</p>
<h2><strong>The future of marine conservation?</strong></h2>
<p>Wider applications for these cost-effective robots are already being seen in the fields of ocean governance and resource management, and gliders are being used to monitor fish stocks and patrol the ocean for any signs of illegal activity.</p>
<p>Backeberg adds that the gliders are also beginning to assist in fish stock assessments. The information collected by these robots is providing a vital component to our understanding of fish stock health, fish migration and distribution patterns.</p>
<p>But there are limitations.</p>
<div id="attachment_380" style="width: 938px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mm.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-380" class="size-full wp-image-380" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mm.jpg" alt="A newly acquired CO2 measuring wave glider being transported in Cape Town%2c South Africa before deployment into the Subantarctic Zone (Credit: SOCCO)" width="928" height="541" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mm.jpg 928w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mm-300x175.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-380" class="wp-caption-text">A newly acquired CO2 measuring wave glider being transported in Cape Town, South Africa before deployment into the Subantarctic Zone (Credit: SOCCO)</p></div>
<p>“[The gliders] rely on acoustic measurements to estimate fish stock sizes. But acoustic measurements are unable to tell you what type of fish is being monitored. To do that you would still rely on ship measurements and stock assessment trawls,” he says.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, Backeberg backs the use of intelligent technology in conjunction with existing methods to monitor the ocean.</p>
<p>“Unmanned robots may be an important component of future marine conservation, but they will need to be used in combination with ship surveys and satellite measurements.”</p>
<p>Huge economic benefits are also in store.</p>
<p>Swart says efforts to improve ocean governance and resource management through technology will be able to feed directly into South Africa’s initiative to unlock the potential of its “blue” economy, dubbed <em>Operation Phakisa</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Phakisa</em> programme was launched in October 2014 by South African president Jacob Zuma to maximise the enormous economic potential of oceans while preserving them.</p>
<p>Ocean activity contributed 54 billion rand to South Africa’s economy and accounted for approximately 316,000 jobs in 2010, according to the government figures.</p>
<p>Swart sees the success of glider research missions potentially leading to economic growth.</p>
<p>“Gliders are a key part of unlocking the wealth of our ocean blue economy,” he says. “They can assist in understanding the ocean, protecting and managing its resources, and manage disasters and pollution.”</p>
