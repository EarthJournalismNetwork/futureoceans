								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People love the ocean. Science has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Mind-Surprising-Healthier-Connected/dp/0316252085/">shown</a> it. But do they value it?</p>
<p>Not enough, ocean advocates would say. Or at the very least, the love we humans have for the oceans is not reflected in our collective behavior and our policies. Otherwise, the oceans would not be in the damaged state we find them today, their fish stocks depleted, coral reefs degraded and waters debased by all manner of garbage and pollutants.</p>

<p>In purely monetary terms, economists have estimated the total value of the ecosystem services provided by the oceans at around <a href="http://awsassets.wwf.org.au/downloads/mo036_reviving_the_ocean_economy_23apr15.pdf">$24 trillion</a>. If they were a country, the oceans would have the seventh largest economy on the planet, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/total-value-earths-ocean-24-trillion-its-falling-fast-wwf-1893415">according</a> to Ove Hoegh-Guldberg of the University of Queensland. But this value is declining rapidly as they become more exploited and further polluted. To cite just one statistic, a <a href="http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/living_planet_index2/">new report</a> states that marine species have declined by 39% between 1970 and 2010.</p>
<p>How can we communicate the value of the oceans in a way that gets the public and policy-makers to act more responsibly? It’s a puzzle that activists, scientists, journalists and indeed anyone who loves the ocean have been pondering with limited success.</p>
<p>In the future, say some ecologists and social marketing experts, the answer could well be informed by some relatively new scientific disciplines. Emerging fields such as neuroscience, behavioral psychology, even new understandings in evolutionary theory may augment the way we communicate about the oceans. In particular, say some advocates, calls for marine protection need to be more emotionally focused, at least in wealthy societies, and based more on appeals to group identity as the messages are spread to the developing world.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it is technology that will make the difference. Could the advent of social media, or the spread of some next generation tool such as virtual reality change public awareness about the oceans? Then again, the answer could be much simpler, and may lie in better understanding and adopting the science of narrative structure to ocean communications.</p>
<p>To see where we’re going, we first need to see where we’re at. There is significant skepticism about the efficacy of current efforts to communicate about the oceans, which these days tend to combine the dissemination of basic information with some mixture of fear, hope and wonder.</p>
<h2><strong>A Growing Sea of Media</strong></h2>
<p>While our fascination with the oceans probably goes back to the time humanity’s evolutionary forebears crawled from the sea, most experts you talk to about modern communications usually begin by referring to Jacques Cousteau. One of the pioneers of nature programming on TV, he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau">helped produce</a> more than 120 documentaries about the ocean (and over 50 books), which were a huge influence on those of us who grew up in the 1960s and 70s watching shows such as <em>The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau.</em></p>
<p>Given how remote and unseen most ocean life is to the average person, these efforts to communicate marine science are even more vital than for other environmental issues. Today, there are more beautifully shot ocean documentaries available than ever, many of them containing striking high-definition footage of the wonders of the deep.</p>
<p>The number of marine parks, aquariums and marine life centers has also steadily grown, offering more opportunities for the public to learn about and explore the oceans and their inhabitants. “It’s so hard to see what’s going on beneath the surface of the ocean. That’s why aquariums play such a powerful role, they have emotional impact on audiences,” says Nancy Baron of COMPASS, which works with scientists to help them communicate. “Places like the Monterey Bay Aquarium have done so much, because people have an emotional experience from what they’re seeing.”</p>

<p>Journalism continues to produce some profound reporting that help the public to understand how the oceans are changing. Writers such as <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-altered-oceans-sg-20060730-storygallery.html">Kenneth R. Weiss</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Carl-Safina/e/B000APJCLI/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1444322997&amp;sr=1-2-ent">Carl Safina</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/David-Helvarg/e/B001K7PU34/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1444322896&amp;sr=1-2-ent">David Helvarg</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paul-Greenberg/e/B001H6J2I2/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1444322855&amp;sr=1-2-ent">Paul Greenberg</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Charles-Clover/e/B001JP4M36/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1">Charles Clover</a> and most recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/24/world/the-outlaw-ocean.html">Ian Urbina</a> have produced ground-breaking books and series on marine topics.</p>
<p>And scientists such as Sylvia Earle, Jeremy Jackson and Daniel Pauly are also working as communicators to help the public understand these issues. Ben Halpern, a researcher at UC Santa Barbara, has created the <a href="http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/">Ocean Health Index</a>, an innovative ranking system that Baron believes can help policy-makers by providing a comprehensive assessment of the state of the oceans through a relatively simple framework.</p>
<p>But there is reason to question the effectiveness of many of these approaches. Aquariums, for instance, can be expensive to visit, and marine life centers are now subject to criticism for holding marine mammals (among other species) in captivity. Journalists and scientists remain hugely important in their ability to uncover hidden trends and scandals, and to reach out to audiences beyond those who already care. But their voices are becoming increasingly diluted in the growing sea of media and entertainment options.</p>
<p>And those beautiful documentaries may not be having as much of an impact as we’d like to think on the public. “Jacques Cousteau tried to set a good example for the telling of compelling stories, but when he exited there was no one to pick up the mantle,” argues Randy Olson, a scientist turned film-maker.</p>
<p>Could advances in media technology come to the rescue? Perhaps the most obvious potential lies in the digital media revolution we’re currently witnessing. In particular, social media has greatly decentralized (or “disintermediated”) the way information is spread about the oceans and other current affairs, and has had a major impact on the way the public consumes news, opinion and information.</p>
<p>This has enabled NGOs and scientists to reach out directly to the public, without having to work through professional journalists. And campaigners are entranced by the possibility of having their messages go viral. They point to examples like the “Under the Dome” documentary on air pollution in China which reached hundreds of millions of people (before being shut down by the government), or the recent outcry spurred by the killing of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1kHXaW88yhs?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;w=560&amp;h=315" height="315" width="100%"></iframe></p>
<p>But skeptics question whether this may be fool’s gold. “I think much more relevant to Cecil than any­ change of collective conscience is to look at the KONY 2012 event — another example of social media going nuts over having found a clear and pure devil,” says Olson. “It’s much more about the unifying power of hatred than anything so uplifting as protecting nature.”</p>
<p>Equally enticing is the ability to spread information through mobile phones, and what’s more, to collect data. “We have already seen mobile technology play a role in some of our campaigns,” confirms Brooke Sadowsky of the group <a href="http://www.rare.org/">RARE</a>, which runs social marketing campaigns on environmental themes.<br />
“We can send out reminders about hunting seasons, for instance, or have volunteers carry out reporting activities.”</p>
<p>Local partners of Internews’ Earth Journalism Network<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> (EJN) in <a href="http://internews.org/our-stories/press/sos-sms">Indonesia</a> and the <a href="http://internews.org/our-stories/project-updates/local-journalists-philippines-use-sms-get-information-their-communities">Philippines</a> have used SMS networks to collect data and report on illegal activities, such as encroachment by loggers in the forests of <a href="http://internews.org/our-stories/program-news/new-media-empower-local-communities-indonesia">Kalimantan</a>. “Most of our target audience don’t have access to smart phones yet, but they can certainly play a big role in the future,” adds RARE’s Sadowsky. “There are major opportunities to create apps and games that can support the messages and norms we’re trying to spread.”</p>

<p>Data journalism is another fast-growing segment of the media world, and has been building on the huge amounts of environmental data available to the public. EJN has again worked with local partners to create a series of <a href="http://www.geojournalism.org">GeoJournalism</a> sites that combine interactive maps, visualized data and traditional journalism to shed new light on crucial regions such as the <a href="http://www.infoamazonia.org/">Amazon</a>, the <a href="http://www.infocongo.org">Congo Basin</a> and the <a href="http://www.thethirdpole.net">Himalayas</a>.</p>
<p>So far, only the <a href="http://www.ekuatorial.com">Ekuatorial</a> platform in Indonesia has focused on ocean issues, providing maps of marine protected areas, biodiversity zones and close-to-real-time marine traffic. Given how hard it is to get solid information about what’s going on at sea, if journalists or scientists can find ways to display visualized data from satellites, underwater probes and other forms of remote sensing, it has real potential to keep the public and policy-makers updated with crucial information about the oceans.</p>
<h2><strong>Virtual Oceans</strong></h2>
<p>Perhaps the most enticing media advance on the horizon is virtual reality. Imagine if you could enjoy the experience of diving at a remote, pristine coral reef in the comfort of your living room without the hefty price tag? It could potentially provide access to the wonders of the deep in a way that even IMAX films and aquariums couldn’t match.</p>
<p>Actually, most ocean communicators seem <a href="https://medium.com/@cartelmike/why-vr-storytelling-does-not-currently-work-and-can-it-ever-work-728ff15efb1c#.t3h7opr17">skeptical</a> that advances in media technology could have a significant impact on the public’s relationship with the oceans, or on their support for ocean conservation. Indeed, it could conceivably have the reverse affect if people come to feel it’s no longer as necessary to protect marine sanctuaries once they’re captured in virtual reality. But some are intrigued by the possibilities of this new technology.</p>
<p>“From what I’ve heard, I would think experiencing the oceans in virtual reality would help. It could show a pristine environment and then a damaged one,” suggests John Baker managing director of <a href="http://www.wildaid.org">Wild Aid</a>, which is working to stem the illegal wildlife trade. “Perhaps there could be a virtual aquarium, like a planetarium, that we could show to local communities. Maybe they can put some of that technology into schools.”</p>

(Credit: Ms. SmittyB/Flickr)</p></div>
<p>“There’s a chance it could have a popular impact,” adds Baron. “We have to try every avenue. One size does not fit all.” Perhaps it could help address the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_baseline">shifting baselines</a> problem that environmentalists bemoan, in which the public doesn’t realize the natural treasures being lost because they’ve only experienced a diminished world.</p>
<p>“The potential is there with virtual reality,” says ocean ecologist Wallace J Nichols. “But it would be a continuation of the technology we have now. We already have a lot of high-definition, 3D images of nature that most people have never seen. We know a movie is pre-filtered, manufactured. It’s different from something that’s un-scripted. There’s something about the multi-sensory experience that makes memories into nostalgia, that creates memory packed with emotion.</p>
<p>“Movies can do that but it’s rare. There’s always hype that ‘this movie is going to be world-changing’, but then people walk out and it’s relatively quickly forgotten. Rarely do you meet a conservationist who says she or he chose this career because of an IMAX movie. People fall in love with a reality-based experience.</p>
<p>“So virtual reality would be interesting, but not quite awe-inducing, not transformative. Maybe there’s a technological leap that suddenly makes it more impactful. But moving through real space and time and using all your senses still beats that. I’d still prefer to jump into an ocean for 15 seconds than watch a film.”</p>
<h2><strong>More Honest, Less Earnest</strong></h2>
<p>Olson, the communications critic who is coming out with a new book called <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo21174162.html"><em>Houston, We Have a Narrative: Why Science Needs Story</em></a>, puts it this way: “New technology is still only about style.  What is needed is more focus on substance — meaning figuring out the narrative dynamics — which means identifying the large scale solutions, then figuring out how to communicate them efficiently in a manner that is not boring or confusing.  Unfortunately the people responsible for this haven’t yet cracked that nut yet.</p>
<p>“If you want to know how bad ocean communication is, just go to any ocean film festival. The films are painfully dull and repetitive. There is a lack of understanding, interest and capability for storytelling, as well as a lack of understanding of entertainment in general.”</p>
<p>Olson argues that there is a similar problem in the communication of ocean science. “Even today it is very hard to get a clear picture of whether world fisheries are collapsing or stable, and of just how dire the picture is for coral reefs. Earlier this year, <a href="http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/12/24/biosci.biu198">a paper on ‘ocean calamities’</a> from Carlos Duarte suggested that some scientists have overstated the problems. It sparked a lot of controversy and indignation, along with a <a href="http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/65/8/745.full?keytype=ref&amp;ijkey=fSLsWtF70U5Xfgz">rebuttal</a> led by [NYU environmental studies professor] Jennifer Jacquet. But they hit on some truths. It’s a narrative mess.”</p>
<p>In short, he believes ocean communications needs to be more honest and less earnest. “The best hope is to propagate a wider understanding of the importance of having ‘narrative intuition’,” he claims. “There is a science to narrative. It needs to be brought to bear on ocean conservation issues.”</p>
<p>New York Times <a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/">DotEarth</a> blogger Andrew Revkin agrees with Olson that the “formula” many conservation groups use in their communications is confusing and even counter-productive. “You can&#8217;t say the world is ending and point to simple fixes at the same time,” he contends. “You can say things we care about, like coral reefs, are at risk and there are ways to cut those risks. But how do you engage disengaged audiences on that? What would the perfect film on conservation in the Anthropocene look like?”</p>
<p>Perhaps the best recent example of an effective communications campaign has been the work carried out by Wild Aid in China, which has been widely praised in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-china-victory-for-wildlife-conservation-as-citizens-persuaded-to-give-up-shark-fin-soup/2013/10/19/e8181326-3646-11e3-89db-8002ba99b894_story.html">helping to reduce the consumption</a> of shark fins. The group <a href="http://wildaid.org/sites/default/files/resources/SharkReport_Evidence%20of%20Declines%20in%20Shark%20Fin%20Demand_China.pdf">claims</a> that there has been an “82% decline in sales reported by shark fin vendors in Guangzhou, China and a decrease in prices (47% retail and 57% wholesale) over the past two years… 85% of Chinese consumers surveyed online said they gave up shark fin soup within the past three years, and two-thirds of these respondents cited awareness campaigns as a reason for ending their shark fin consumption.”</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/world/asia/china-says-no-more-shark-fin-soup-at-state-banquets.html">government ban</a> on shark fin soup at state banquets, where the dish was seen as a major status symbol, was a major factor in its declining popularity, acknowledges Wild Aid’s Baker. “The fact that the government had an explicit position goes a long way in China.” But there were a number of keys to the campaign’s success of the campaign, he adds, most notably the willingness of the hugely popular and respected former basketball star Yao Ming to serve as its spokesman.</p>
<p>“We came at it from every angle – overfishing, depleting the oceans, the cruelty involved in finning, toxicology due to accumulated heavy metals. Most people in mainland China didn’t even realize what was in the soup, because the term for it in Mandarin doesn’t include the word shark,” explains Baker. “It helped that CCTV [China’s gigantic public television network] produced a segment for their 60 Minutes-like news program. And we had huge support from media partners, equivalent to about $200 million in donated media to air public service announcements, which we got for free. We don’t use overly graphic imagery, and we run campaigns that are generally positive rather than shaming wrong behavior.”</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/28838668" width="100%" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Wild Aid is now leading campaigns against the consumption of manta rays, elephant ivory and rhino horns, using the star power of Jackie Chan and David Beckham, among others. “Some people say China will never change, but our experience is that it’s actually changing quite fast, and in many ways for the better,” says Baker.</p>
<p>“The Wild Aid campaign looks like an excellent case study in how to use mass media and the power of celebrity effectively,” says Olson. “I give them the highest marks for effective communication in ocean conservation, with Sea Shepherd [which has generated considerable media attention by obstructing whalers on the high seas] a close second. Most NGOs are too literal minded to understand how it all works.”</p>
<p>Still, Baker acknowledges that campaigning to protect animals such as sharks and rays is probably easier than working on more abstract or diffuse issues, such as halting overfishing, ocean acidification, preventing trash and pollution from entering the ocean, or protecting coastal ecosystems: “The more specific it is and the more it relates to people’s lives, the easier it is to communicate.”</p>
<h2><strong>Peer Pressure</strong></h2>
<p>If communications campaigns are to grapple effectively with these broader issues, they will probably need to come up with new approaches, according to RARE’s Sadowsky and her colleague Kevin Green.</p>
<p>“The most disruptive technology in social change is the emergence of new fields in behavioral sciences, looking at how people make decisions and cooperate,” explains Green. “Traditionally, social marketing focused on how behavior related to the costs and benefits for individuals. Social change industries were built on the assumption that people are rational maximizers – <em>homo economicus</em>.</p>
<p>“But the new field of behavioral economics, and new ideas from social psychology, political science and evolutionary theory are converging on how humans cooperate. That is altering how we approach behavior change. People can act collectively if they’re motivated to do so, and there are no greater collective action problems than oceans and climate change.</p>
<p>“An example of the new approach would be messaging that works to strengthen group identities. For instance, if you have a community that is comprised of many different fishers, you would try to get them all to adopt sustainable management practices. They might not have a sense of their group identity, or that identity might just be latent or not strong,” says Green. “So, first you need to strengthen group identity by using messaging that promotes existing values that enable them shift norms collectively.”</p>
<p>“Previously, we just reached out to individuals as to why they should change their behavior,” adds Sadowsky. “Now we’re trying to establish normative behavior. A lot of research has shown &#8212; even in the US but especially in developing countries &#8212; that the sense of what other people are doing is hugely motivating to get people to try things they haven’t done before, and getting them to stick to it. It’s the different between using a ‘we’ term as opposed to a ‘you’ term.”</p>
<p>Green and Sadowsky point to successful strategies such as the <a href="https://opower.com/solutions/energy-efficiency">Opower Energy Efficiency</a> approach, where energy consumption in a neighborhood is made publicly observable. When people see how their neighbors are reducing their energy consumption, they are motivated to do likewise. Another example is the messaging you often see in hotel rooms, urging patrons to re-use their towels to save on the electricity (and the cost) used in washing them. It turns out, explains Sadowsky, that standard environmental messaging works less well in such cases than messages which state, for instance, that a majority of the previous residents in that hotel, or even in that room, re-used their towels.</p>
<p>The research findings have essentially re-emphasized that humans are social creatures, and that social marketing programs – especially when aimed at resolving collective action problems &#8212; have to focus on “moving the herd” as opposed to a bunch on individuals. “We call them Pride campaigns, because pride in a community or their environment is one of the most powerful motivating forces, even when trying to put food on the table,” explains Green.</p>
<p>And if that pride is not there, or if a norm doesn’t exist in a community, social marketers look to connect groups, especially as the issues they’re tackling get bigger and even global in nature. That’s where media can be helpful. Green cites the Ice Bucket Challenge that spread like wildfire (ostensibly to raise money for ALS research) as an example of the power of social media in particular, but he and his colleagues are looking to change norms as opposed to a one-off action.</p>
<p>“When a norm doesn’t exist in one place but does elsewhere, we have to tap into that normative behavior even if it’s not within eyesight,” he concludes.</p>
<h2><strong>Marine Neuromarketing</strong></h2>
<p>Nichols, meanwhile, has been studying a different approach, looking at what neuroscience research has to say about individual human behavior. But his conclusions seem to fit in well with those of the social marketers.</p>
<p>“Neuroscience will change the way we do laws and education, so it will also be useful in understanding why water is appealing,” says Nichols, the author of a book – <em>Blue Mind </em>– whose tag line essentially comprises its thesis:<em> The Surprising Science That Shows How Being Near, In, On or Under Water Can Make You Happier, Healthier, More Connected and Better at What You Do. </em> “There’s lots of interesting research going on, although it’s not necessarily right on the dot in terms of ocean conservation.”</p>
<p>Nichols and his colleagues <a href="http://blogs.edf.org/edfish/2012/01/03/neuroconservation-your-brain-on-ocean/">brought together</a> some leading neuroscientists with some of the best people working with water to use electroencephalograms and fMRI equipment to see “<a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/07/19/why_our_brains_love_the_ocean_science_explains_what_draws_humans_to_the_sea/">why our brains love the ocean</a>.”</p>
<p>“The ocean gives us oxygen, jobs and seafood, but it also gives us romance, creativity, solitude, spirituality, privacy, relaxation, and a feeling of awe. Fishermen love the feeling of being out on the water, although they may not talk about it in public, and it’s the same with scientists who work on the ocean.</p>
<div id="attachment_645" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/17986164044_ed817eded0_o.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-645" class="wp-image-645 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/17986164044_ed817eded0_o-e1455305002671.jpg" alt="(Credit: Petra Manche/NOAA's National Ocean Service)" width="2000" height="1080" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/17986164044_ed817eded0_o-e1455305002671.jpg 2000w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/17986164044_ed817eded0_o-e1455305002671-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/17986164044_ed817eded0_o-e1455305002671-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/17986164044_ed817eded0_o-e1455305002671-1020x551.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-645" class="wp-caption-text">(Credit: Petra Manche/NOAA&#8217;s National Ocean Service)</p></div>
<p>“The number one source of awe for people is nature, and within nature it is bodies of water, according to a <a href="http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_awe_makes_us_generous">study</a> by UC Irvine and UC Berkeley. This feeling of awe gives us higher feelings of empathy and compassion, and shifts our perception of time, shifts us from a ‘me’ perspective to a ‘we’ perspective.</p>
<p>“This has implications for conservation. Once we understand it better, it could change the way we talk about the oceans. Currently, we don’t see words like ‘awe’ and ‘romance’ and ‘creativity’ in such communications, instead the focus is on economic value. But whenever we put a number on the blue economy it massively undervalues the worth of the oceans.”</p>
<p>Nichols is aware that his exploration of these themes has opened him to criticism. “People ask me why I’m wrecking my career as an ecologist,” he admits. “But hanging out with neuroscientists &#8212; it’s the hardest science in the room, it’s not ‘touchy-feely’. Neuromarketers put these lessons into practice. Corona uses Blue Mind to sell bad beer. McDonalds and Coke sell love and happiness. We in the conservation community shy away from those words.”</p>
<p>There is indeed criticism of this approach. Olson agrees that “Ocean Lovers” is a real phenomenon — people become so infatuated with the oceans they can’t get enough of just loving them. But when it comes to communications, he complains, it’s also the recipe for boredom.</p>
<p>RARE’s Sardowsky points out that if the audience is first world donors, the emotional hook is extremely important to get them to sign a petition or give money to a cause. But for audiences such as those in the developing world who are concerned about survival every day, even if emotion plays a big role, there has to be a material benefit for collective action.</p>
<p>Then there are the “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/09/mindless">new neuro-skeptics</a>” who question what the approach of using neuroscience to determine how we make decisions has gotten us thus far. “A core objection is that neuroscientific ‘explanations’ of behavior often simply re-state what’s already obvious,” writes Adam Gopnik in <em>The New Yorker</em>. “Neuroscience can often answer the obvious questions but rarely the interesting ones.”</p>
<p>One of the more interesting questions that neuroscience should seemingly be able to help answer is how do we make decisions. In fact, the study of “decision science” now goes back decades and has been often <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by9Ih-ZlIzk">cultivated toward environmental ends</a>.</p>
<p>“What’s missing is that there’s a vast subconscious we’re not aware of, but that is where the action is,” claims Nichols. “It’s not necessarily that ‘you’re deciding’, but it’s more about behavior science. We can look at what a brain does when someone is answering questions, and often it will indicate something very different from what they’re saying. The truth is we don’t really know why people decide – calling it ‘motivation science’ might be a better term, or the science of drive.</p>
<p>Nichols is a fan of the book <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes'_Error">Descartes’ Error</a></em> by the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, which claims that humans are driven more by irrational tendencies than we’re willing to admit. After reading it, Nichols came to accept that actions are often driven by emotions, not a rational analysis of information.</p>
<p>Neuromarketers are trying to turn the art of persuasion into something <a href="http://www.iftf.org/uploads/media/SR-1321_IFTF_FutureofPersuasionReport-1.pdf">approaching a science,</a> but they haven’t thought much about the oceans yet. Still, says Nichols, their work could have implications for the way we communicate about the ocean. It could help us better time our delivery of conservation messages, for instance, by displaying them when people disembark from whale-watching boats or come ashore after kayaking.</p>
<p>“I understand there are reasons why big NGOs and funding agencies tend to go too narrow too quickly in their messaging. It’s easier to justify to lots of people, but it’s wrong,” he asserts. “There’s a disconnect between the Neuroscience departments and the Ecology departments on campus, even though they may only be a couple of minutes away from each other.”</p>
<p>Green from RARE concludes that, “we often rationalize after the fact, but by and large we are not rational decision-makers. Decisions are often made at least as much on an emotional basis. It’s not a purely selfish maximizing calculation, but sometimes we’re afraid to admit that.”</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>What can we conclude from all this speculation about the future of ocean communications?</p>
<p>There will always be a need to communicate the rational basis for protecting the oceans, to explain what the data is telling us about their status, and to offer up practical science-based solutions. That has always been vital, but it appears not to be sufficient.</p>

<p>Increasingly, communications experts are telling us that as much as we may worry about the state of the oceans, spreading fears and lectures about impending doom should take a back seat to the use of peer pressure and the adoption of entertainment techniques in efforts to change public policy and behavior. This is particularly true if the goal is not just sustainability, but preservation.</p>
<p>Scaring people can spur action, but inspiring them may be more sustainable in the long run. After all, there has always been a mythical, or mystical, component to conservation. We don’t just protect forests or landscapes because we need them, but also because of the way they make us feel to be in them, or just to look at them.</p>
<p>Maybe what all the technology and the neuroscience and the social marketing research is telling us is that, to value and protect the oceans, we first need to remind people how much they love them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a Chinese restaurant in a Las Vegas strip mall, Austin Ayer tries to act nonchalant as he orders the most controversial item on the menu.</p>
<p>“Do you want crab in your shark fin soup?” asks the waiter. “It tastes much better.”</p>
<p>“No, just shark fin,” says Ayer. “And I’d like it to go.”</p>
<p>The waiter takes measure of the strapping university student, who, with his blue eyes and rosy cheeks, perhaps doesn’t fit the description of a typical shark fin soup customer. The waiter shrugs: “That’ll be $21.57.” Ayer hands over a credit card. He slowly exhales at the ringing of the cash register.</p>
<p>Minutes later in the parking lot, Ayer opens the pint-sized styrofoam container and pours some soup onto a tray in his makeshift mobile genetics laboratory: the back of his Scion hatchback. He quickly gets to work before his shark fin samples are compromised. “I need to get this out of the hot broth and onto ice as soon as possible,” he says.</p>
<p>Fishing around with long metal forceps, he pulls out chunks of meat. “This looks like crab,” he says. “That’s not what we want.” He sets it aside and teases long, elastic, translucent noodle-like strips from the broth: they look like the tendons that give shark fins their strength. “This is looking better. Here we go.”</p>

(Credit: Kenneth R. Weiss)</p></div>
<p>He washes a few of the filaments with a squirt of distilled water and tucks them in a test tube with an enzyme solution for later genetic tests. If all goes well, the telltale DNA inside the stringy bits will reveal whether the soup contained shark species banned under international law.</p>
<p>Genetic identification has become faster, cheaper, and more reliable in recent years, with advances coming so quickly that even enterprising undergraduates like Ayer can now fashion themselves as DNA detectives. In the not-too-distant future, next-generation sequencing—which allows machines to read millions of gene sequences in one batch—and the promise of a rapid or instant DNA test will transform much of what we know about life in the sea and how fast we can know it.</p>
<p>Combined, these quantum jumps in technology will provide exacting ways to measure if the seafood supply is safe and honest, offer biologists new methods to track elusive endangered species, and empower regulators with instant forensic evidence to crack down on illegal wildlife trafficking or determine the species of fish caught in nets far from shore. And if breakthroughs continue apace, consumers will soon be able to deputize themselves as genetic gumshoes, testing the halibut on their plate to quickly determine if it really is halibut, no matter if it has been filleted, frozen, or fried.</p>
<p>At the center of this revolution is an ID system that uses a snippet of DNA sequence data that belongs to a particular species, with the ambition to build a digital catalogue that includes every species on Earth. These distinct sequences, named DNA barcodes after the familiar black and white stripes on products scanned at the supermarket, are stored on centralized databases. When researchers isolate the right DNA sequence from a new tissue sample, it can be compared to all identified species on file to see if it’s a match. So far, more than 11,000 fish have been ID’d and catalogued within the <a href="http://www.fishbol.org">Fish Barcode of Life</a> computerized repository. It’s part of a larger effort, the <a href="http://www.ibol.org/">International Barcode of Life</a> (iBOL), which has analyzed close to five million samples representing more than 525,000 different species on land and at sea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the race is on to provide a rapid DNA test that Paul Hebert, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Guelph in Ontario and scientific director of iBOL, likens to the handheld “tricorder” used on Star Trek to boldly scan and identify life forms throughout the sci-fi universe. “That’s the world we are heading to,” he says, “reading all forms of life like people read thermometers.” Having this futuristic handheld technology would shorten the time from sample to positive species ID, a system that now requires samples to be sent to a lab for processing and DNA sequencing before they can be compared to a database such as the Fish Barcode of Life.</p>

<p>In a reflective moment, Hebert acknowledges that Spock’s tricorder might not be a perfect comparison because it doesn’t require a tissue sample or even skin contact. “From that standpoint, it’s wrong technically,” he says. “You don’t have that much DNA floating in the air.”</p>
<p>That’s not a problem in the oceans. Fish and other marine creatures regularly slough cells in seawater, leaving telltale environmental DNA (eDNA) in the area that can be read through next-generation sequencing. By processing some water samples, Hebert says, the new technology can “read all of the species that have been in that water that day.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, for example, researchers released the results of the four-year seafaring Tara Expedition, which collected eDNA instead of museum specimens to glean new insights into the interactions of millions of species of plankton, from viruses to microscopic animals.</p>
<p>What’s remarkable is that until the 1970s, scientists didn’t know most of these microbes existed in ocean waters because they couldn’t see them, says Stephen R. Palumbi, a marine biologist at Stanford University<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>“Next-generation sequencing is one of the most astounding breakthroughs in biology in the past 20 or 30 years,” says Palumbi, adding that its potential is just beginning to emerge. Federal government researchers are using it to track elusive porpoises in Alaska and determine if rare spring-run Chinook salmon are making it into the headwaters of the Columbia River. Some scientists are collecting eDNA from ocean water to assess every species that lives in a marine reserve. Others are experimenting with paring eDNA, which identifies which fish are present, with acoustic data from fish-finding sonar to estimate their abundance. Such experiments seek a non-lethal way to survey fish populations, rather than traditional method of catching fish in a trawl net and counting them when they are dead.</p>
<p>It’s possible that one day soon, a fisheries manager who wants to check on commercial catch could rinse a fisherman’s net and scan the rinse water for a genetic signature of every kind of fish that had been caught. That’s on Palumbi’s long to-do list. “Extracting the data is easy,” he says. The hard part, he adds, is finding a commercial fisherman who will allow an outsider to wash his nets for genetic scrutiny.</p>
<p>Palumbi, who is also director of Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California, has been a pioneer in using genetics in marine biology, including taking the lab on the road. He and colleagues repeatedly set up a surreptitious DNA laboratory in a Tokyo hotel room throughout the 1990s that revealed how Japan’s whalers were violating international law by hunting and selling the meat of humpback, blue, gray, fin, and other great whales—far beyond their limited permit to take minke whales for “scientific research.”</p>

<p>Initially, their methodology and findings were denounced by the whaling industry, yet Japan’s government soon cracked down on contraband and mislabeled meat.</p>
<p>“When we started testing whale meat, the process was tedious and laborious,” Palumbi says. “All that is changing with the new technology. It’s easier, cheaper, and more reliable. A high school freshman could do it, if we showed her how.” But could he teach a journalist to do it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My stint as a temporary lab tech began two months before I went shark fin shopping in Las Vegas with Ayer. I’m driving north toward Pacific Grove when my phone chirps with a text from Palumbi: “Don’t forget your homework.” It’s late and the sushi bars will be closing soon, thwarting my assignment to deliver fresh sushi for sequencing the next morning. A Japanese restaurant beckons from alongside the highway and I find myself sitting at a sushi bar directly beneath the stern gaze of a muscular sushi chef.</p>
<p>Palumbi has his students test their sushi as a primer to DNA sequencing. He says it’s remarkable how often salmon turns out to be trout, flounder gets sold as sand dab, various white fish are billed as cod, and red snapper, or even halibut, is switched out for cheaper farmed tilapia. Restaurants, especially sushi bars, are apparently the worst offenders. Palumbi’s instructions? Bring at least six different types of fish to the lab, and keep them fresh.</p>
<div id="attachment_521" style="width: 3274px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/sushi.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-521" class="size-full wp-image-521" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/sushi.jpg" alt="Not quite what I ordered: fish sold as ono (the white fish seen at the bottom of the picture) turned out to be escolar when tested in the lab (Credit: Kenneth R.

(Credit: Kenneth R. Weiss)</p></div>
<p>I order the biggest sashimi platter on the menu, a colorful display of 24 slices of six kinds of fish, asking the chef to point out the various pieces on the plate. He rattles off the names so fast, it’s hard to keep track. As a self-styled sushi sleuth, I need to maintain chain of custody for each sample, getting the assigned names, so I can verify species by their genes. It’s impossible to catch the eye of the busy chef to pose a question, so I wave the menu and begin ordering side dishes. Each time he hands me a new plate, I hold up another piece of sashimi, asking, “What is this?” Soon he’s grumbling in Japanese. When I’m sure I’ve almost worn out my welcome, I give him a big smile and ask for a to-go container. He thrusts a styrofoam box at me without a word. I organize my catalogued specimens in the box, then push my luck and ask for a plastic bag filled with ice. He ignores my question and instead calls out to one of the servers, and, pointing to me, yells, “Check!”</p>
<p>The next morning, the Palumbi Lab emerges from the fog in the heart of the Hopkins Marine Station, which is perched on a rocky point overlooking the churning Pacific Ocean next to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The lab is already full of busy students by the time I arrive at 8:30 a.m. with my samples on ice.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day, I follow Palumbi’s tedious 19-step recipe for preparing tissues for DNA sequencing. It begins with tugging on purple gloves, and using sterile needles to dig out a tiny piece of fish flesh—smaller than a grain of rice—and easing it to a test tube filled with solution. It’s delicate work and, after a half-dozen of these sushi surgeries, I stick myself with a sharp needle and bleed all over the lab.</p>
<p>Aside from helping me staunch the bleeding, Palumbi is a hands-off instructor. First, I dose the samples with the enzyme proteinase K to chemically chew up the tissue and release the DNA. Then, I follow more than a dozen more steps before I load the tubes—now filled with clear liquid—into a sophisticated apparatus the size of a home bread machine where they’re “baked” with the chemical instructions to make thousands of copies of the tiny piece of DNA for easier identification.</p>
<p>All this has to happen before I can send my samples for sequencing. The results come back a few days later via email: each sample translated into a long string of the letters A, T, C, and G—abbreviations for the nucleotide bases that are the building blocks of DNA—each sequence between 570 and 650 characters long. It looks like a child has maniacally typed the letters in random fashion over and over. One by one, I cut and paste the results and enter them into the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) on the National Institute of Health website, to see what I had actually eaten. It takes only seconds to compare the sequences to all of the DNA data collected around the world.</p>

<p>The salmon checks out, as do most of the other pieces. Then I load up the sequence for the ono, also known as wahoo by sports fishermen who revere this bigtasty fish, and send it to BLAST. Six seconds later, I have my answer. It isn’t ono, but a snake mackerel called escolar that has earned the nickname “Ex-lax fish.” Italy and Japan have banned escolar because it contains gempylotoxin, an indigestible wax that can bring on violent cramping and orange diarrhea.</p>
<p>Escolar is often sold as white tuna or by other names in sushi bars, according to conservation organization Oceana’s genetic testing in 2013, which showed a third of seafood was mislabeled in American restaurants and markets. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not banned escolar, but advises against its sale. The FDA got more involved in seafood mislabeling in 2007, when toxic pufferfish from China was sold as monkfish, sickening people and sending at least one to hospital. Since then, it has installed DNA sequencing machines in nine regional laboratories, and set up its own DNA library of the 700 or so most commonly eaten fish—with each barcode tagged to a species identified by expert taxonomists. Rigorous chain of custody is required so federal investigators can prosecute fraudulent mislabeling with DNA evidence that will stand up in court.</p>
<p>Bait-and-switch tactics, such as substituting cheap Vietnamese farmed swai, similar to catfish, for more expensive “red snapper,” remains common among imports that now make up more than 90 percent of US seafood consumption. Federal inspectors struggle to keep up with the flow of fish, much of it arriving after being processed at sea and hard to visually identify. The DNA analysis helps, but the process can be slow and cumbersome as inspectors collect samples, bring them to regional labs and then wait—for days or longer—for the results.</p>

<p>“I would love to see a portable sequencer and rapid extractors,” says Jonathan R. Deeds, principal investigator of the FDA’s genetics project to combat fish fraud. In the meantime, the FDA has experimented with the University of Guelph’s <a href="//itunes.apple.com/us/app/lifescanner-fda-edition/id950330936?mt=8">Lifescanner App</a>, which could quickly transmit test results from inspectors carrying tablets or smartphones to regional labs and FDA headquarters once such rapid DNA tests become reality.</p>
<p>Government and private industry are racing to further technologies that will ultimately help to positively identify fish and other species by their genes on the spot. The US Army’s biosecurity labs at Fort Detrick in Maryland, for instance, are researching methods to instantly identify anthrax and other pathogens. And commercial biomedical research firms are working on the technology, hoping to cash in on quick diagnosis for common bacteria and viruses that plague human patients. There’s even an early version of a handheld unit, developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies in England.</p>
<p>A cottage industry has emerged, with genetic testing companies offering to help restaurants, fish mongers, and seafood distributors clean up their supply chain to avoid running afoul of the law or facing hefty fines. And some researchers are identifying more elaborate genetic markers that go beyond ID’ing the species to differentiate among various populations so scientists can determine where the fish are caught. A consortium of European researchers uses genetics to trace the geographic origin of cod, for instance, whether it’s caught legally or plundered from overfished waters.</p>
<p>Kathy Moore, forensic biologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Charleston, South Carolina, expects that eventually it will become cost-effective to identify genetic profiles for an individual high-priced fish, such as a big blue fin tuna—essentially having a DNA tag that will follow the fish from the boat to the plate. Moore, who works with a <a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ia/iuu/taskforce.html">presidential task force</a> to combat illegal fishing and seafood fraud, has spent decades helping prosecute sea turtle poaching cases, sometimes relying on little more than swabs of turtle blood off baseball bats, knives, and spears that were matched against NOAA’s own curated DNA database of protected species.</p>
<p>All these genetic tests are complex variations of what I am doing in the Palumbi Lab. During my day there, I work alongside Austin Ayer, who is diving into his shark fin science project. While I process my sushi dinner leftovers, he snips and prepares tiny pieces from fins left in the lab’s freezer from when Palumbi used to send his students to Chinatown in San Francisco to purchase shark parts for DNA identification. That was before California banned their sale in 2013, a reaction to the barbaric practice of cutting off a shark’s fins and throwing the writhing animal overboard to bleed to death. Shark populations have plummeted around the world, in large part to meet the demand for shark fin soup, a luxury dish in Chinese culture that has become a symbol of status and wealth.</p>
<p>Inspired by Palumbi’s success in shaking up the Japanese whaling industry, Ayer wanted to do something similar, but only had a summer to tackle a project for his senior honors thesis and still graduate on time. So he settled on trying to replicate the pioneering methods of a <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114844">study</a> published in February 2015 that showed that even in places where shark fin soup is legal, it often contains fins from sharks that are illegally traded. The study found fins of two types of hammerheads in soup purchased in the United States, and managed to identify seven out of eight types of endangered sharks—including whale sharks, basking sharks, and great whites—that are illegal to ship across borders without a permit.</p>

<p>Palumbi approved Ayer’s project. Yet one hurdle remained. When California banned possession of shark fins, getting samples was no longer a convenient matter. So to find the closest place that has a concentration of restaurants with customers willing to shell out handsomely for a high-priced status symbol in a small bowl, Ayer needs to cross state lines.</p>
<p>“I never thought I’d be going to Las Vegas,” he says, “to do field research in marine biology.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before Ayer picks me up along the eight-hour drive to Sin City, he calls every Chinese restaurant in Vegas he can find that reputedly sells shark fin soup. Few show shark fin soup on their online menus, yet, in reality, most of them offer it. Quietly. To those who ask. Prices range from US $20 to $300 a bowl. But would they sell it to him?</p>
<p>Ayer asks Palumbi for guidance, given that his professor has experience buying strange things from the sea for genetic analysis. “It won’t be the weirdest thing that happens in Las Vegas that night,” Palumbi advises him. He suggests that Ayer simply use his chopsticks at the table to pull out shark fin filaments and put them in test tubes. Ayer has another plan: “Ideally, we get as many orders to go as we can.”</p>
<p>The first test comes in the Chinese restaurant in the Vegas strip mall. It’s 37 °C and Ayer opens the restaurant’s double glass doors to a blast of air conditioning. The restaurant is nearly empty. “We are about to find out if this is going to work,” Ayer says under his breath.</p>
<p>After making a successful buy and processing the samples in the sunbaked parking lot, Ayer repeats the routine at another local establishment in Las Vegas’s Chinatown. Then he is ready to hit the Strip. Ayer calculates that his research grant will cover 11 soup samples, provided he limits himself to mid-range prices, nothing more than $70 a bowl. It’s time to go to a high-end joint where discriminating customers would insist that shark fin is the real deal.</p>

<p>Oversized chandeliers, obsequious waiters, and white tablecloths greet our arrival at Jasmine, the Chinese restaurant inside the Bellagio hotel and casino. Plush curtains and valances frame the window overlooking the lighted fountains that dance in the desert night to synchronized music. Shark fin is nowhere on the pricy menu. Ayer orders spring rolls to buy a little time.</p>
<p>When a waitress comes by, Ayer learns the restaurant offers three versions of the soup: the basic, for $60, and the deluxe with a two-ounce clump of shark fin tendons for $150, or a three-ounce clump for $180. Not a high roller, Ayer orders the basic</p>
<p>As soon as it arrives, Ayer receives a text from a friend who needs a pickup at the airport. He snags the server and asks for a to-go cup. The soup is whisked away and returned in a fancy white cardboard box with Bellagio’s looping serif logo. Within minutes, he’s processing the sample in the back of the Scion in the Bellagio’s stifling hot covered parking lot, breathing fumes of the trapped auto exhaust.</p>
<p>We’ve picked up Ayer’s friend and it’s getting late, but Ayer is hoping for one more sample. The Beijing Noodle No. 9 at Caesars Palace is just across the street. It’s almost closing time and the hostess does not want to seat us, but then a gregarious server wearing black-rimmed attitude glasses allows us inside, asking us to order quickly before the kitchen shuts down. He recommends the Singapore noodles and General Tso’s chicken. We accept, but Ayer also asks for shark fin soup. It isn’t on the menu, but the waiter confirms it’s available—a small bowl for $99 and a bowl with a fin for $199—but he has some advice: “Skip it. It’s not worth it. If you asked for it, I don’t think I’d sell it to you. They cut off the fin and let the shark die. It’s so mean.” Ayer skips it. The price is way out of his range.</p>
<p>We close down the Beijing Noodle, head to the Strip for a midnight beer, and then crash for the night at a budget motel. The next morning, we part ways and Ayer spends that day and evening collecting more soup and samples before making the long drive back to the Pacific Grove lab, two ice-packed coolers with his carefully preserved samples in the hatch.</p>

<p>In this forensic work, obtaining and preserving samples with intact DNA is critical: DNA degrades as tissues break down, shattering the long strands into smaller and smaller pieces until they are too short and fragmented to be useful. The challenge facing researchers scrutinizing shark fins is to find a short strand that will survive all of the insults—drying, bleaching, boiling in soup—but one that’s long enough so that they have the information needed to identify a specific species. By Monday morning, Ayer is struggling with the initial round of results from his Las Vegas samples, picking up DNA from other ingredients added for flavor. “There’s tons of DNA in the soup,” he tells me, “[but] half the time, it comes back as pig, or chicken, or crab, or shrimp.”</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, Ayer keeps working on the samples—extracting the DNA and sending it off for sequencing. The results? He was able to isolate enough genetic information to identify the species of shark from every soup he purchased. But one DNA barcode stood out from the rest. It came from a scalloped hammerhead, a warm-water shark so endangered that it has joined the list of species illegal to trade internationally. The discovery left him with mixed feelings of sadness and excitement. “It’s a double-edged sword,” Ayer says. “It’s a bummer to find endangered species. But it makes my project more compelling, a more interesting story to tell.”</p>
<p>The global demand for shark fin soup is driving scalloped hammerheads toward extinction. This shark, with its bizarre head shaped like a sci-fi spaceship, is targeted because its large fins are loaded with ropy strands of collagen that are prized by consumers. The restaurant probably had no idea it was serving the fin of an endangered shark. The distributor was also likely unaware, as were perhaps others in the supply chain that passed through Hong Kong, a hub of the global trade. Short of a global ban on shark fin soup, how can the sharks most threatened with extinction be saved? And can genetics play a role in the solution?</p>
<p>Palumbi considers genetics an insightful tool that can penetrate the most opaque aspects of the seafood market, whether properly identifying whale meat in a Tokyo display case, a box of fish fillets arriving on the docks in Los Angeles, or a fin swimming in a bowl of soup in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before we were blind,” Palumbi says, “but now we can see: DNA technology gives us a vision of what’s in that bowl of soup. Sometimes we find out bad things, but that makes us double down to fix those problems. It’s not just a bowl of soup, but a bowl with strands from an endangered species swirling around. And once we find that out, we can do something about it.</p>
