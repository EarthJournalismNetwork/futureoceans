								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few palm trees stand strong in the salty breeze. Located on the southern tip of the Pacific island chain of Hawaii, Kamilo Beach is an isolated stretch of black volcanic shoreline in the middle of nowhere. Just a few hundred yards from shore, humpback whales rise up from the depths, colorful fish fill the reefs and rare sea turtles swim in to nest on the beach.</p>
<p>But even in this remote place, garbage washes ashore each day. “We find a lot of toothbrushes and combs, plastic bottles and caps, over and over again,” says Megan Lamson, a marine biologist working for a local non-governmental organization, the <a href="http://www.wildhawaii.org/" target="_blank">Hawai‘i Wildlife Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Old Hawaiian sayings have described the bay as a place where people went looking for loved ones if they got lost at sea. “Historically that area has been kind of the catcher of things that are floating in the ocean,” Lamson says. But over time, the composition of materials that wash ashore has changed dramatically. “Back in the day it was large pieces of heavy wood from other continents,” she says, “now, unfortunately, it’s a lot of plastic.”</p>

<p>It’s an all too familiar sight around the world. Since the early 1970s, researchers have collected plastic from beaches and oceans around the globe. At the 9-mile (14-kilometer) stretch of coastline around South Point alone, about 15 to 20 tons (14 to 18 metric tons) of trash wash up each year. “Here on Hawaiian beaches, we have debris from all around the North Pacific,” Nikolai Maximenko, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, explains. Some pieces come from Asia, others from the West Coast of North America, and, Maximenko adds, “of course we have local products, too.”<i> </i></p>
<h2><b>From Gyre to Garbage Patch</b></h2>
<p>To understand how a remote place like Kamilo can get so swamped by massive amounts of trash, one must consider the hydrodynamics at play.</p>
<p>Hawaii is located in a huge circular system of ocean currents, the North Pacific Gyre. Within the gyre, trash can get trapped and circulate for years. One region between the islands and California contains such a high density of man-made debris that it has been nicknamed the Eastern Pacific Garbage Patch. When currents change, the garbage can wash back ashore — and so it is found on beaches like Kamilo.</p>
<p>At the International Pacific Research Center in Honolulu, Maximenko and his colleagues have taken major steps in understanding how marine debris travels the oceans’ currents. He and his team have developed a computer simulation that can project the behavior of floating items at sea. By using drifter buoys and satellite data, the model indicates <a href="https://vimeo.com/8350606" target="_blank">how trash accumulates in the oceans</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/8350606" width="100%" height="375" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Most debris <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gm2EjYbUXk" target="_blank">ends up in the five big subtropical ocean gyres</a> located in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans, which rotate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern. Water samples collected from these regions show elevated concentrations of plastic particles, and the evidence that the oceanic gyres are becoming marine debris hot spots continues to grow. According to new models by researchers from Australia, a sixth gyre might form in future decades — in the Arctic Barents Sea.</p>

<h2><b>Back From the Sea</b></h2>
<p>Each September, on <a href="http://www.oceanconservancy.org/our-work/international-coastal-cleanup/" target="_blank">International Coastal Cleanup d</a><a href="http://www.oceanconservancy.org/our-work/international-coastal-cleanup/">ay</a>, hundreds of thousands of volunteers across the globe roam the shores to collect trash. The effort not only removes litter, but also generates data that can provide a glimpse of what the oceans might contain.</p>
<p>In 2014, more than half a million participants collected over 16 million pounds (7,200 metric tons) of trash in just one day. The top five most commonly found items were cigarette butts, food wrappers, bottle caps, straws, stirrers and beverage bottles — common items of today’s modern consumer society. Collectors also found lawnmowers, light bulbs, wigs and even shopping carts.</p>
<p>Though many of these items are quickly discarded, they are made from a material that might last decades or even centuries.</p>
<p>The damage and suffering this causes for ocean life is severe. Plastics can be found in the stomachs of whales, fish and many other marine animals. Turtles suffocate when they confuse shopping bags with jellyfish, or drown when they get entangled in discarded nets. Seals get stuck in plastic rings from six-packs that slowly cut through their necks. In the middle of the Pacific, albatross chicks die, weakened from overconsumption of bottle caps and toys. The Convention on Biological Diversity <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/publications/cbd-ts-67-en.pdf" target="_blank">counts 663 species affected by ocean plastics</a>.</p>
<p>Another species that might be affected is the one that’s responsible. In 2015, researchers sampled fish and shellfish being sold for human consumption in Indonesian and Californian markets. They found plastic and textile fibers in <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14340" target="_blank">a quarter of the animals</a>.<b> </b></p>
<h2><b>A Grand Plan</b></h2>
<p>A solution is urgently needed. So why not just go and clean it up? There’s no lack of imagination when it comes to concepts to <a href="http://www.floatinghorizon.org/3rd-party-concepts.html" target="_blank">retrieve garbage from the sea</a>. Designers and engineers have proposed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VExyml-HGi0" target="_blank">marine drones</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBpSHoTXHrg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m22s" target="_blank">waterborne kites</a>, even <a href="http://www.evolo.us/competition/seawer-the-garbage-seascraper" target="_blank">huge artificial drains</a> for the gyres. A group of college students from London went so far as to promote the idea of <a href="http://2012.igem.org/Team:University_College_London" target="_blank">creating biotechnological microorganisms</a> to break up the plastics, and a Dutch architect wanted to <a href="https://vimeo.com/30893953" target="_blank">turn the trash into a “Recycled Island”</a> where people could settle sustainably. Despite the attention these concepts have gained, most of them have remained pretty 3-D renderings and — so far — unfulfilled ambitions.</p>
<p>Experts have tried to convey what a massive challenge it would be to clean up the ocean’s trash. The National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration has estimated <a href="http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/can-you-clean-pacific-garbage-patch" target="_blank">it would take 68 ships an entire year</a> to survey just 1 percent of the North Pacific. In another, more hypothetical calculation, ocean activist Charles Moore estimates that to clean all five garbage patches, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=SLyAg4qJvOQC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=moore%20plastic&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=79%20years&amp;f=false" target="_blank">1,000 boats would need to filter the water 24 hours a day for 79 years</a>, and that’s only if the technology existed.</p>
<p>But Boyan Slat, a young Dutch inventor, has tried to challenge the skeptics. Just out of school, he presented his ambitious idea to filter the open ocean in 2012: Instead of sending out boats to go after the trash, he argued, why not take advantage of the forces provided by the rotating currents of the gyres? If a filtering platform could be fixed to the seabed underneath the North Pacific garbage patch, one could get the trash out while the water flowed through it — and maybe even sell it for profit.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROW9F-c0kIQ&amp;w=560&amp;h=315" height="315" width="100%"></iframe></p>
<p>Slat’s idea soon went viral and earned him a massive following, praise from around the world and millions of dollars in crowdfunding.</p>
<p>The project’s feasibility, however, has been under critical scrutiny. Kim Martini and Miriam Goldstein, both ocean scientists and bloggers, warn that Slat’s project could cause more harm than good by threatening delicate zooplankton and other animals living near the sea surface. The two also <a href="http://www.deepseanews.com/2014/07/the-ocean-cleanup-part-2-technical-review-of-the-feasibility-study/" target="_blank">point out how difficult it would be to fix the structure to the seabed</a>. They call Slat’s current plans “under engineered and likely to fail.”</p>
<p>To many environmentalists, Slat’s approach is flawed on a more fundamental level. They argue that by starting cleanup efforts when trash has already made it into the ocean <a href="http://inhabitat.com/the-fallacy-of-cleaning-the-gyres-of-plastic-with-a-floating-ocean-cleanup-array/" target="_blank">diverts attention from the real solutions</a>: reducing, reusing and recycling.</p>
<h2><b>Plastic Islands</b></h2>
<p>For many decades, environmental organizations have tried to raise awareness of how anthropogenic debris impacts marine life. But what finally sparked alarm among the public were reports of massive trash islands in the ocean, one reportedly “twice the size of Texas.” The only problem? The islands don’t really exist.</p>
<p>In fact, plastic is distributed quite widely over the vast oceans. The garbage patches are not solid islands, but regions where relatively high concentrations of small plastic pieces are dispersed in the upper part of the water column, hardly visible from above.</p>
<p>So how much is in there, really? Estimates on total plastic accumulation in the world’s oceans have ranged from the thousands to hundreds of millions of tons. While some figures that have been cited by media are pure speculation, others rely on data that are decades old. “In the open ocean, the abundance, distribution, and temporal and spatial variability of plastic debris is poorly known,” a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5996/1185.full" target="_blank">team of experts concluded</a> in 2010.</p>
<p>To produce more accurate estimates, scientists have carried out a number of studies in recent years, but figures still vary considerably. While it’s possible that researchers will never come up with a precise figure, plastic pollution will most likely grow in scale with rising production.</p>
<h2><b>The Rise of Plastics</b></h2>
<p>For a long time, the development of plastics was perceived as a big success story. And not without good reasons: Synthetic materials have advanced human civilization, wealth and comfort in uncountable ways.</p>
<p>In 1907, the Belgian-born chemist Leo Baekeland developed Bakelite, the first synthetic plastic polymer, branded “The Material of a Thousand Uses.” Bakelite was moldable, heat-resistant and nonconductive, so it was soon used for a multitude of products, from electrical insulators and casings for telephones and radios to toys, poker chips and firearms.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, new synthetic materials started surfacing on the market.</p>
<p>Global plastic production rose from <a href="http://www.plasticseurope.org/documents/document/20131014095824-final_plastics_the_facts_2013_published_october2013.pdf" target="_blank">1.7 million metric tons (1.9 million tons) in 1950 to close to 299 million metric tons (330 million tons) in 2013</a>. And the numbers continue to grow. Today, it is hard to think of products that don’t contain or aren’t wrapped in plastics. Plastics make transportation more carbon efficient, keep food fresh to avoid wasting it and allow us to see through contact lenses — to just name a few benefits.</p>
<p>But the negative effects on the environment have also been pervasive. A few decades of heavy use have spread plastics around the globe. Today, the remnants of our products can be found <a href="http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/4/140317" target="_blank">from the surface of oceans to deep-sea sediment</a>, in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/us/scientists-turn-their-gaze-toward-tiny-threats-to-great-lakes.html" target="_blank">lakes</a> and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749114000475" target="_blank">rivers</a>, even <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/05/trillions-plastic-pieces-may-be-trapped-arctic-ice" target="_blank">frozen in Arctic ice</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Catching the Trash</b></h2>
<p>While efforts to find a viable method to clean existing ocean plastic are laudable, they won’t stop more trash from entering the oceans, often through rivers and streams.</p>
<p>In Baltimore, an inventor had an idea to catch the trash before it could reach the high seas. John Kellett worked near the city’s heavily polluted harbor for many years — an “ugly piece of water” to most visitors, as he recalls.</p>
<p>Kellett realized that much of this plastic reaching the harbor came from the Jones Falls, a stream that accumulates trash as it winds through residential neighborhoods.</p>
<p>With local partners, Kellett began working to construct a device that would skim garbage from the surface of the river before it could float downstream: a solar- and wind-powered, trash-intercepting waterwheel.</p>
<p>No longer just an idea in Kellett’s head, the <a href="http://baltimorewaterfront.com/healthy-harbor/water-wheel/" target="_blank">Inner Harbor Water Wheel</a> was deployed in 2014 and has become a prominent city landmark. Resembling a giant nautilus, it has orange booms that cover the 35-meter-wide (40-yard-wide) mouth of the Jones Falls and directs items floating on the surface to a conveyor belt, where they are collected before they can reach the harbor. The trash is then emptied into a large container under the waterwheel’s white roof and hauled off.</p>

<p>Kellett estimates that around three-quarters of the trash that would have floated into the inner Baltimore harbor is now being caught instead.</p>
<p>“Its footprint is tiny, its reach is huge,” deep-sea biologist <a href="http://www.southernfriedscience.com/?p=17362" target="_blank">Andrew David Thaler wrote</a> about the waterwheel, and he is not the only marine scientist who has praised Kellett’s attempts to clean up closer to the source.</p>
<p>So will waterwheels be a familiar sight at most river mouths one day? Kellett hopes this won’t have to be the case. “We find that a small river is a challenging place to try to clean the trash out of,” he admits. Although the inventor has received a number of requests to deploy his technology in other places around the world, and he sees good potential to scale it up for midsize rivers and harbors, his ultimate goal is to put the waterwheel out of work. As he points out, if there were better education, legislation and technology, the trash might not show up in the rivers and travel to the ocean in the first place.</p>

<h2><b>New Challenge: Microplastics</b></h2>
<p>At the Wuppertal wastewater treatment plant in Germany, foggy clouds hang low on the green hills around large pools. In a noisy hall, big metal rakes work hard to hold back the solid trash that the wastewater carries with it, from wet wipes, condoms and toilet paper to wood and the occasional stone.</p>
<p>Outside, the water flows into large filtering pools, measuring 20 to 30 meters (70 to 100 feet) in diameter. There, everything heavier than water is separated mechanically. Only some Q-tips are light enough to escape. The water is then directed into bubbling pools, where bacteria digest all they can.</p>
<p>“Our microorganisms have a life span of around 10 days,” explains Volker Erbe, technical division manager of Wupperverband, the entity that takes care of water management around the river Wupper and runs the Wuppertal wastewater treatment plant. Plastics, however, are not on their menu, he says. Which is unfortunate, because there is a new challenge wastewater treatment plants have to deal with — and it’s almost invisible.</p>

<p>Micro- and nanoplastics are the new category of plastic litter that even facilities in the most developed countries are not yet equipped for. And so, though the water may look clean, it really isn’t.</p>
<p>The source can be inspected in many bathrooms around the world. From toothpastes and deodorants to shower gels, eye shadow and sunscreen, numerous beauty products contain tiny plastic particles, a <a href="http://unep.org/gpa/documents/publications/PlasticinCosmetics2015Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank">2015 U.N. Environment Programme</a> report reveals. They deliver active ingredients, exfoliate, regulate viscosity and fulfill numerous other functions. And this is not new: Producers of cosmetics and cleaning agents have been adding plastics to their formulas for decades.</p>
<p>Some products are made up of 90 percent of these tiny plastic grains. They are so small their size is described in micrometers, which are a thousandth of a millimeter. For comparison: A human hair is around 100 micrometers thick. Some producers even go tinier and add nanoplastics, which are in the range of millionths of millimeters. To also put this into perspective: Human DNA is 2.5 nanometers in diameter.</p>
<p>How many of these particles reach rivers and streams, and eventually the ocean, is still unclear.</p>
<p>At the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in northern Germany, a research team under senior scientist Gunnar Gerdts has conducted a <a href="https://www.awi.de/nc/en/about-us/service/press/press-release/pilot-study-reveals-new-findings-about-microplastics-in-wastewater.html" target="_blank">pilot study</a> to find out how much plastic escapes wastewater treatment plants. “I expected that we wouldn’t find very much, because nanomaterials are said to be held back pretty well by the sewage sludge,” explains Gerdts, “but what we actually found was that wastewater treatment plants do emit microplastics into the rivers in substantial ways.” He notes that the amounts his team found in samples from different facilities varied greatly, so more research is needed to understand the scope of the issue.</p>
<p>The impacts of the tiny particles and fibers on marine animals are still under investigation. For some species, such as mussels, lab experiments have shown <a href="https://www.awi.de/nc/en/about-us/service/press/press-release/microplastics-in-the-ocean-biologists-study-effects-on-marine-animals.html" target="_blank">adverse health effects</a> such as inflammation. And there are other risks: Plastics can contain problematic additives such as bisphenol A, and microbeads show a tendency to <a href="http://www.pelletwatch.org/" target="_blank">attract persistent organic pollutants such as DDT</a> from the water around them. That could result in quite a cocktail accumulating in animals up the food chain.</p>

<p>Micro- and nanoplastics are particles and not uniformly distributed, so measuring their concentration is a difficult process, unlike pharmaceuticals, which dissolve in water and are therefore present in every probe. To not only detect micro- and nanoplastics, but hold them back completely in a wastewater treatment plant, requires a whole additional stage of cleaning, which comes at a cost that is ultimately passed down to consumers.</p>
<p>“The moment of truth is out there when wastewater treatment plants decide that it’s a priority for them not to let go of microplastics,” says Lars Grønbæk, a process engineer working for the Danish wastewater purification company KD. Grønbæk is a specialist in membranes that can remove tiny particles from water using a principle similar to a coffee filter.</p>
<p>It’s “not new rocket technology,” Grønbæk says. His company’s flatsheet membranes are already capable of filtering down to a size of a tenth of a micron, he says, and they could be further refined. But at the moment, only a small fraction of wastewater treatment plants are deploying membrane filters, says Grønbæk. As long as there is no regulation requiring them to do so, this is unlikely to change.</p>
<p>Volker Erbe of Wupperverband believes there is a better way to tackle the issue: “We need to think about not using materials that can become a problem for the environment, instead of trying to remove them with expensive technologies from our wastewater.”</p>
<p>It seems that the first steps in this direction are being taken. In late 2015, President Obama signed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1321" target="_blank">the Microbead-Free Waters Act</a>, which bans tiny plastics in cosmetics and other products.</p>
<h2><b>Fibers From Washers</b></h2>
<p>Another, equally unexpected source of microplastic pollution seems further away from a solution: the plastic footprint of washing machines. Much of the clothing produced today is made out of synthetic materials. Each time these clothes are washed, thousands of tiny plastic fibers can leak from the machine into the wastewater.</p>
<p>Dick Vethaak, professor of ecotoxicology at the VU University of Amsterdam, observed that more than <a href="https://www.deltares.nl/en/news/extra-filter-washing-machines-welcomed/" target="_blank">200,000 of those fibers can escape</a> in just one wash cycle. This is many times more than what previous studies had reported.</p>
<div id="attachment_748" style="width: 1810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/5348966161_368b34e25c_o.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-748" class="wp-image-748 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/5348966161_368b34e25c_o.jpg" alt="(Credit: Brenda Gottsabend)" width="1800" height="1267" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/5348966161_368b34e25c_o.jpg 1800w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/5348966161_368b34e25c_o-300x211.jpg 300w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/5348966161_368b34e25c_o-1024x721.jpg 1024w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/5348966161_368b34e25c_o-1020x718.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-748" class="wp-caption-text">Each wash cycle can potentially release thousands of tiny plastic fibers. (Credit: Brenda Gottsabend)</p></div>
<p>While most people won’t ever get to see the tiny fibers washing down their drains, a chance encounter had Blair Jollimore quickly looking for a solution. A mechanical engineer by day, Jollimore lives far from city drainage systems in a remote part of eastern Canada’s Nova Scotia. His house requires its own septic system.</p>
<p>One day after moving into his new home, Jollimore recalls, the basement flooded with wastewater. The family soon found out what the problem was, says Jollimore: “a gray mat inside the septic tank” that had blocked the pipe.</p>
<p>He quickly realized that most of what had clogged the system was lint from the water flowing out of his washing machine. So he used a water filter housing and a stainless steel strainer to construct a filtering device that he inserted between the washer and the drain. The septic tank didn’t overflow again.</p>
<p>What was initially just a solution to Jollimore’s own problem turned into a small business on the side, and Jollimore now sells around 50 of his <a href="http://environmentalenhancements.com/index.html" target="_blank">Lint LUV-R filters</a> per month. Together with researchers working on marine debris, he is looking into options for a wider market application of his washing machine lint filter.</p>
<p>If such a filter came standard on washing machines, it would be a quick win for the environment. But experts say designing one that is both cost effective and convenient to build into commercial washing machines will be a huge technological challenge. Producing these filters would be expensive and they could easily clog, making it impractical for consumer use.</p>
<p>And there seems to be little incentive, because neither consumers nor legislators have called to further develop and standardize the technology.</p>
<p>Even if it did become standard, it would only solve a part of the problem. “The same fibers, they also enter the water by air pollution,” Vethaak points out. “The real problem is that the textiles are not environmentally friendly.”</p>
<h2><b>Everything Falls Apart</b></h2>
<p>The biggest source of microplastics, however, is larger items breaking down. Every piece of plastic that makes it to the oceans falls apart with time. Ultraviolet light and the force of the waves degrade fishnets, plastic bags, bottles, caps and toothbrushes into smaller and smaller pieces.</p>
<p>These resulting particles are likely to be the major source of microplastics found in the environment, dwarfing the amount coming from cosmetic products or textiles, a <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/publikationen/sources-of-microplastics-relevant-to-marine" target="_blank">recent study</a> by the Federal Environment Agency of Germany suggests.</p>
<p>Tackling the influx of bigger items into the ocean will therefore be key to eventually reducing microplastic pollution.</p>
<p>Some emerging economies are growing so fast that their waste management systems can’t keep up, and so their contribution to marine debris is enormous. If just five countries — China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines — improved their recycling and waste disposal systems, they could “cut global inputs by almost half,” conclude the authors of <a href="http://www.oceanconservancy.org/our-work/marine-debris/mckinsey-report-files/full-report-stemming-the.pdf" target="_blank">a recent study by the Ocean Conservancy</a>.</p>
<p>Though this won’t stop plastic pollution entirely, it could buy us “time to rethink packaging more broadly and reduce the flow of plastic altogether,” <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/19/cut-plastic-waste-oceans-south-east-asia-fish-birds" target="_blank">the authors explain</a> in <i>The</i> <i>Guardian</i><i>. </i></p>
<p>Europe and North America may be better equipped to deal with their waste, but they also consume <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/global-plastic-production-rises-recycling-lags-0" target="_blank">five times as much plastic per person annually as people in Asia</a>, according to the Worldwatch Institute. And many of these richer countries export a large portion of their plastic waste, much of it ending up in China. With a global market that ships not only products, but also waste, the plastic problem is a truly global one.</p>
<p>Considering the vast scale of the world’s oceans, and the many pathways through which trash can make it there, it is unlikely that we will be able to find one technology to solve this complex and difficult problem. Many solutions will need to be conceived of and deployed at various levels in order to tackle plastic pollution from all possible angles. But the closer we can move from the gyres to the source, the better off our future oceans will be.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/coral-green.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-97 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/coral-green.jpg" alt="coral-green" width="100" height="113" /></a></p>
<p>Inside sits an array of temperature- and pH-controlled tanks, sediment pumps, and stacks of high-octane computers. With all that tech, AIMS, a federally funded research center, can feel a little like NASA, if NASA were dropped in the middle of Australia and had its laser-assisted focus retrained on the oceans. High-security access badges: Check. Brilliant, high-powered scientists: Check. Evocative acronyms: So many checks.</p>
<p>The blocky brick building I come to at the end of 50 km of wallaby-strewn highway is an unassuming advertisement for the pie-in-the-sky projects unfolding inside. And so, with not a little cognitive dissonance, I sign my name on a standard-issue clipboard, and head to the world’s first Sea Simulator — the SeaSim, for short.</p>
<p>The 10,000-square-foot facility was built with the help of a $27 million <a href="http://www.scienceinpublic.com.au/media-releases/37-million-sea-simulator">grant</a> from the Australian government (that’s $37 million in AUD) and the ambition to do the kinds of long-running, multi-variable experiments never before possible in run-of-the-mill marine biology labs.</p>
<p>The sprawling building contains an upper story with a double row of sealed rooms, each controlled by a monitor panel outside. In some, heavy-duty pumps suspend dredge sediment in tanks lit a deep dance-club blue; others hold aquariums full of crown-of-thorns starfish, nightmarish, spiny creatures whose unchecked appetites have decimated whole swaths of reef.</p>
<p>But downstairs, I find what I came for: an enormous, open-plan room that will hold the nine tanks of Madeleine van Oppen’s time machine.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/round-5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-98 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/round-5.jpg" alt="round-5" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/round-5.jpg 150w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/round-5-87x87.jpg 87w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>In February of this year,</strong> Madeleine van Oppen and her colleague Ruth Gates of the University of Hawaii published a paper suggesting that we start researching whether it’s possible for humans to help corals evolve to survive in a climate-changed world.</p>
<p>They called it “assisted evolution,” and it was a new approach to the same old problem: Corals already possess some innate resilience, but they cannot evolve fast enough to keep up with the accelerating pace of climate change. So let’s just make them evolve faster.</p>
<p>With a grant from the Paul-Allen-funded <a href="http://www.pgafamilyfoundation.org/oceanchallenge/">Ocean Challenge</a> prize, covering a five-year-long research project split between AIMS and the University of Hawaii, van Oppen and company set out to see if that’s even possible. If they could breed new generations of corals that outperformed their parents, maybe they could identify the secret to coral resilience, be it genetic, microbial, or something else altogether.</p>
<p>And for that, they need corals. A lot of them.</p>
<div style="width: 1330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/p1020361.jpg?w=1320&amp;h=742" alt="" width="1320" height="743" /><p class="wp-caption-text">AIMS staff unload samples of coral and sand from the Great Barrier Reef, to be used in SeaSim experiments.

<p><strong>The boat comes in in the afternoon.</strong> Van Oppen drives me down to the port, where researchers with a heavy crane are lifting pallets of stacked plastic bins from the deck of the dive boat into the back of a truck. It’s sunny, so they work fast — these corals have come from Davies Reef, a nearby patch of the Great Barrier, and they are likely feeling the heat.</p>
<p>As he sloshes excess seawater out of the bins, research manager Neal Cantin explains to me what they’ve brought back: entire tubs of sand and sediment, heaps of worn-down and overgrown old coral skeletons (or “live rock”), some algae and sponges for a different experiment, and, of course, about 80 coral colonies for van Oppen’s experiment.</p>
<p>The corals are the main event, but the sand and sundry are important, too. With all these ingredients — and the ambient microbial communities they host — the researchers can create a rough copy of the reef the corals just left. Then, using data from a weather tower right over Davies Reef, they can adjust the water temperature throughout the day to match natural conditions as closely as possible.</p>
<p>I hitch a ride back to the SeaSim with a couple of tubs of coral and live rock. There, in the largest chamber of the Sea Simulator, Cantin and a graduate student are arranging the corals in three long tanks, flushed with seawater and lit with full-spectrum LEDs that mimic sunshine. These tanks will serve as an indoor ocean to these corals for the next five years, or longer.</p>
<p>Eventually, there will be nine tanks in the enormous, hangar-like room, grouped by threes: One trio will be treated with water heated and cooled to match the real-time temperature data from Davies Reef. The pH levels will match normal variations the reef might experience over the course of an average day, becoming more acidic at night, in the absence of photosynthesis. The second set will have its water heated and soured to match the ocean conditions we are predicted to experience by midcentury. The third will experience the most extreme conditions, with temperatures and acidity mimicking what we might see by 2100 if climate change is left unchecked.</p>
<p>All the corals will spend a few months acclimating to these new normals. The scientists expect many of them will become stressed, even bleach — but that’s only the beginning. What they really want to find out is how the kids do.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/dory.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-99 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/dory.jpg" alt="dory" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/dory.jpg 150w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/dory-87x87.jpg 87w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The idea that humans might “assist evolution,” while it sounds wacky, is not truly anything that new.</strong> We’ve been changing the evolution of plenty of species, intentionally and otherwise, for about as long as we’ve been living in social groups. We “assist” evolution when we breed animals to perpetuate traits — milk production, for example, or docile behavior — that we find beneficial. We also can be said to assist evolution when we build environments, like cities, where certain animals, like pigeons, can find an ecological niche that never existed in the wild.</p>
<p>And we’re <em>already</em> applying selective pressures to coral. From global warming to ocean acidification, we’re changing the natural environment such that some corals are better adapted to survive than others. But evolution, while it’s happening, is not happening fast enough — and those selective pressures of ocean acidification and ocean warming run the risk of selecting reefs right out of existence.</p>
<p>Genetic selection is the most familiar kind of evolution, but the process of accumulating genetic adaptations is typically a slow one, reliant on chance mutations that occur in the right place at the right time. And corals only spawn once a year and grow slowly — which means there aren’t many chances to get things right.</p>
<p>So van Oppen’s group is looking to find the helpful mutations first, and maybe eventually find a way to spread them among wild corals. She is also looking for “epigenetic” changes in the corals, which is a catch-all term for the things that act on the genome, but are not a part of it.</p>
<p>For example, certain molecules may be attached to parts of an organism’s DNA, controlling whether a certain gene is turned on or off. If the gene is turned off, the cell won’t produce the protein that the gene codes for. In this way, an individual of a species may possess all the genes necessary to produce some trait without actually <em>expressing</em> the trait — all depending on its epigenetics.</p>
<p>These epigenetic markers have, in some cases, seemed to be heritable from a parent organism to its offspring. Van Oppen believes that epigenetics may hold the key to jump-starting corals’ non-traditional evolution in the face of warmer, more acidic waters. And if we can get a head-start on climate change by seeing what these changes might look like, maybe we can help nudge today’s reefs in the direction they need to go.</p>
<div style="width: 1330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/p1020441.jpg?w=1320&amp;h=730" alt="" width="1320" height="731" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Baby Pocillopora growing up in the SeaSim tanks. (Photo credit: Grist | Amelia Urry)</p></div>
<p><em><strong>Pocillopora</strong></em><strong> — “poss-ill-uh-pour-uh” — </strong><em><strong>acuta</strong></em><strong> are pale, knobby lumps of coral</strong>, each about the size and shape of a head of cauliflower. They are fast-growing and branching, which makes them important reef building species, not unlike the more common <em>Acropora</em>.</p>
<p>But <em>Pocillopora</em> do one weird thing differently from most other corals. Instead of spawning just once a year, <em>Pocillopora</em> can reproduce asexually, releasing fully formed clonal larvae every month or so. In van Oppen’s lab, these larvae will settle onto little ceramic discs prepared by researchers and start to grow. Some of the baby corals will be moved around — the hot future larvae back to cold present-day tanks, and vice versa — to see how they do. Then this whole step will be repeated one more time, with a third generation of corals.</p>
<p>If the second- and third-generation of corals born and raised in future ocean conditions seem robust, that may tell us about how reefs could change in real-time. But even if corals are capable of keeping up with stressfully high temperatures and acidity, they still may change in ways that will fundamentally change the reefs themselves. The corals may not grow as fast, and they may reproduce differently. Larvae might have more trouble developing, or might develop differently.</p>
<p>And if the third generation of <em>Pocillopora</em> do end up stronger than their forebearers? The next step could be one of sci-fi proportions: to take these speed-evolved corals out onto the reef. These ultra-resilient corals could potentially be used to restore damaged reefs, while providing a set of genes that could pass some of that accelerated resilience on to the next generation.</p>
<p>The other experiments van Oppen’s team will be running have some similarly stunning implications. For example, if the scientists experimentally evolve a strain of symbiotic zooxanthellae that makes its coral host more resistant to bleaching, they could conceivably grow huge tanks of it, to dump on reefs during especially hot spells.</p>
<p>To be clear, these are all pretty long shots for a lot of different reasons. But even if they’re shown to work, is it a good idea?</p>
<p><em> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/rounded-4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-100 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/rounded-4.jpg" alt="rounded-4" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/rounded-4.jpg 150w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/rounded-4-87x87.jpg 87w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></em></p>
<p><strong>“It’s not up to us in the end</strong> whether it will actually be implemented,” Madeleine van Oppen told me, before I could even ask. Her experiments are such an early step on the road to large-scale reef engineering that she only spends a few minutes talking about the possibility. For van Oppen, the important thing is that we at least start asking the right questions. Answering them is a whole different research project.</p>
<p>What we definitely don’t want to do, she says, is to introduce new problems into a system we’ve already thrown out of whack. “We are very good at messing things up, changing this planet tremendously,” van Oppen says. “We’re also very innovative and intelligent, I suppose. We’ve come up with lots of good solutions.”</p>
<p>One thing is sure: We’ll have to put the brakes on climate change eventually, if we want to stave off disaster — on this point, everyone agrees. But even if we phase out greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10 or 20 years, the atmosphere and oceans will continue to warm for years after — so we need to be prepared to deal with that.</p>
<p>In a certain light, this crisis is nothing new for humans, says van Oppen: “We pollute the environment and then we clean it up. We develop bacteria that can digest hydrocarbons when there’s been an oil spill. It’s no different from other things where we clean up after the mess we have made. We do that all the time. Unfortunately, that’s how humans are.”</p>
<p>I’m starting to get the sense that if scientists, governments, and nonprofits can figure out how to engineer a better coral reef, it will be because, in the end, it’s easier to change nature itself than it is to change human nature.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is a bucket list item if there ever was one. It’s the largest living barrier reef in the world, roughly <a href="http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/about-the-reef/facts-about-the-great-barrier-reef">the size of Italy</a>, and one of the only biological objects visible from space.</em></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/reef.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-101 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/11/reef.jpg" alt="reef" width="100" height="79" /></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Home to some of the strangest (and most venomous) creatures in the ocean, the GBR is a poster child of what we stand to lose as the oceans warm. I had always wanted to see it for myself.</p>
<p>So one morning, on an ocean as flat and blue as a swimming pool, empty of other boats all the way to the cloud-strewn horizon, I hold a mask and regulator to my face and step into the water.</p>
<p>Underneath, huge mounds of coral rise 30 feet from the seafloor almost to the surface. I am surprised to find that these seamounts — called “bommies” in Aussie — are veritable catalogue advertisements of reef health and diversity. I see all kinds of <em>Acropora</em> — big, branching thickets of elkhorn, wide terraces of tabletop coral — all colored a healthy deep orange or yellow. <em>Pocillopora</em> sit on the tops of lower mounts like frilly heads of lettuce. I see enormous brain corals and tiny, fine-fingered soft corals that swayed in the current.</p>
<p>All around these pillars and buttresses, life swarms and flashes like static electricity: angelfish, damselfish, clownfish, a massive school of yellow-finned jacks winding between two bommies. There are skates bearing blue spots the size of silver dollars and parrotfish in all the colors of an 80s aerobics instructor’s leotard. Electric-blue sea stars stand out like asterisks on the sand, where giant clams flick their purple lips as I swim over.</p>
<p>If there is trouble on the Great Barrier Reef — and, by all accounts, there is — I can’t see a sign of it from behind my mask. In all its wild wholeness, this little patch of Edenic reef seems to stand both for what has been lost everywhere else, and what we stand to save.</p>
<p>But as I haul myself back out of the water — suddenly transformed back into a clumsy two-legged creature wearing sixty pounds of dive equipment and a fogged mask in front of my face — I feel both smaller and bigger than before. No matter how much I wanted to believe it while I was underwater, I knew that the idea of a pristine reef is an illusion. There are no virgin reefs to “preserve.” Any reef, any ecosystem, no matter how lovely, is in the process of being affected by the 7 billion (and counting) people of the world.</p>
<p>But that’s the way it’s always been. The reef is always changing: It is fed by currents and smashed by storms, and subject to the whims of the animals moving in waves over it. Flux is a fact of nature, and human are now a part of that.
