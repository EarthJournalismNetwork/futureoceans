								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Hawaii experienced an unexpected coral bleaching event in the fall of 2014, reef managers went out to see the hardest hit reefs. A response team was sent to Kaneohe Bay, Oahu to survey the effects of thermal stress. Since Hawaiian reefs had only bleached once years before, little was known about how the relatively pristine reefs would fare. As Hawaii prepared for another bleaching event in 2015, scientists there were learning more about reef recovery than ever before.</p>
<p>This level of post-bleaching surveying is possible because of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch (CRW) program’s newest coral bleaching monitoring tool. Publicly available online, the satellite mapping product is a marked improvement for monitoring and predicting bleaching events.</p>
<p>It also has major implications for management: Will predictive bleaching forecasts allow reef managers to respond to coral bleaching more effectively?</p>
<div id="attachment_513" style="width: 1244px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kelsey1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-513" class="size-full wp-image-513" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kelsey1.png" alt="Great Barrier Reef, 2014; Credit: XL Catlin Seaview Survey" width="1234" height="609" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-513" class="wp-caption-text">Only two years later: Great Barrier Reef, 2014; Credit: XL Catlin Seaview Survey</p></div>
<p>Right now CRW is recording the third global bleaching event at a finer resolution than was ever possible in the past. It&#8217;s a global event, since consistently warming water temperatures have led to mass coral bleaching in all three of the world&#8217;s major oceans. The first two events, one in 1998 and the other in 2010, were somewhat spaced out, but scientists predict they&#8217;ll become more frequent.</p>
<p>When water temperatures increase an average of two degrees, corals lose the algae that gives them their color. By bleaching, their white skeleton is exposed. Without that symbiotic algae, most corals struggle to feed themselves and can die when turf algae takes over. Corals can recover, but if stressful conditions like warm water temperatures persist the odds are unlikely.</p>
<p>With the ability to create daily 5 kilometer (km) resolution bleaching warning maps, the new monitoring product provides much finer details than its 50-km predecessor. “Managers needed finer details, since most reefs are pretty small, and they wanted predictions about the potential for future bleaching events,” says Mark Eakin, coordinator of the CRW program. By using more satellites and climate models, the monitoring tool can provide detailed daily reports and seasonal outlooks.</p>

<h2><strong>How it’s used </strong></h2>
<p>To make this data user-friendly, CRW created virtual stations for the hundreds of reef managers, scientists, and researchers that use this data all around the world. By designating recognizable places like Maui or and parts of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef as virtual stations, stakeholders can quickly identify places of interest. They subscribe to an email alert system that notifies them when that reef is experiencing stress.</p>
<p>Based on NOAA&#8217;s latest climate predictions, the reports can give some insight into what’s coming months down the line. “Managers love it. We can show week by week what the probability of bleaching for the next four months is,” says Eakin. “They can’t tell you exactly what’s going to happen, but they’re good predictors.”</p>
<p>They’ve been especially useful for field monitoring in Hawaii.  “While we may have not developed a management solution to bleaching, we gathered crucial information about how coral in Hawaii responds to thermal stress and recovers,” says Anne Rosinski, a marine resources specialist at Hawaii’s Division of Aquatic Resources. The 5-km data allowed them to pinpoint specific locations where bleaching was the worst, so they could focus limited field monitoring resources there. Coral bleaching is complicated by Hawaii’s highly variable topography and geology, so having finer details makes monitoring easier there.</p>
<p>Bleaching is the result of global processes that are warming the earth’s oceans, so prevention isn’t possible even if it can be predicted months before.</p>
<p>“Warnings allow us to get ready to record what happens, the death of corals, or if we are lucky, their survival, since they can bleach and recover if it doesn’t get too hot for too long,” says Douglas Fenner, a contractor that monitors American Samoa’s reefs for NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). “We will have the best documented dead reefs the world has ever known.”</p>
<h2><strong>The value of mitigation techniques </strong></h2>
<p>Despite not being able to stop bleaching, the CRW data could help with deciding where to focus response efforts. Shade clothes that float on the water could shield reefs from direct sunlight and limit heating from that radiation. Pumping cooler water from lower depths up to reefs could keep them cooler too. But both methods would be expensive. Many scientists are skeptical about small-scale techniques like this, but others feel they’re practical to use on highly-valued reefs.</p>
<p>Building local resilience seems more plausible; it’s done by minimizing human impacts like tourism, fishing, and agricultural and industrial runoff. This approach has been used for years, but the world’s reefs are still bleaching at alarming rates. “For everything that humans do that damage reefs, some people benefit,” says Fenner. Over 100 countries around the world benefit from reef tourism alone. While economically important, most reefs are exploited.</p>
<p>Yet there is value in being able to identify the strongest reefs through field monitoring like managers in Hawaii are doing. “Some areas might have natural protection, so we can make their survival even more likely by limiting fishing and boat traffic,” says Eakin. With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) future climate scenarios, scientists can identify the best places for long-term conservation efforts too.</p>
<h2><strong>The benefits of long-term planning for conservation</strong></h2>
<p>Reefs can and do bounce back from bleaching events. In 1998 a strong El Nino caused a large bleaching event on western Australia’s Scott Reef. But over the next 15 years the reef came back. A combination of fish that had never been seen at the reef before ate the turf algae that took over the coral skeleton, allowing the corals to recover to nearly the same levels as before the bleaching, though some older ones did die.</p>
<p>Located about 600 km from shore and 1000 km from any major city, the reef was far from civilization. “That shows us how nature has the ability to bounce back from an injury if we leave it alone,” says Eakin. Overuse is one of reasons that reefs in the Caribbean and Great Barrier Reef haven’t been as successful at recovering from bleaching events.</p>
<p>So, is there value in just being able to monitor reefs to inform long-term planning? If it leads to effective marine policy that promotes conservation, then yes. “Approaching marine management from a proactive instead of reactive way allows us to get ahead of the issues,” says Jason Vasques, programs director for the Coral Reef Alliance. Marine policies could halt fishing, tourism, or construction near a reef that is about to bleach or even prevent all of those activities from taking place if the reefs are in a protected area. That at least gives the reef a better chance of recovering.</p>
<p>CRW is a useful predictive monitoring tool and can help managers gain support for conservation, but the global processes that cause widespread bleaching can’t be ignored. The IPCC predicts that by 2050 mass bleaching will occur on a yearly basis, a trend we’re already beginning to see. Stakeholders know that only an international agreement can make a difference. “Just maybe there will be enough political will at upcoming climate change meetings to make a difference,” says Eakin. “Our reefs really do depend on it.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists in South Africa are using ocean robots to study the unexpected and complex interplay between the Southern Ocean and the Earth’s changing climate.</p>
<p>The researchers have been inspired by the fact that this is the least studied part of the planet and yet one of the most dynamic and difficult to understand. It’s also an area of high species abundance and diversity, where common and highly specialized species both thrive.</p>
<p>The Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observatory (SOCCO) research team under the South Africa’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has been using robotics to observe the upper ocean’s physical processes and study their impacts on carbon dioxide exchange between the atmosphere and ocean, as well as on the growth of phytoplankton – microscopic algae that live in the surface ocean.</p>
<p>Local experts say these cutting-edge robotic gliders will shape the future of marine research and environmental monitoring of the Southern Ocean and South African waters. They hope that the data they gather will reveal how human activity is changing the planet.</p>
<p>What is known, SOCCO researchers say, is that the Southern Ocean accounts for fifty percent of all carbon dioxide absorbed by the oceans. This part of the world’s ocean is particularly sensitive to climate change because the creatures living here are susceptible to minor environmental shifts, which can lead to large changes in global ocean currents or ecosystem health.</p>
<div id="attachment_373" style="width: 944px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/A-SOCCO-Seaglider-waiting-to-be-deployed-in-the-Southern-Ocean-Credit-SOCCO.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-373" class="size-full wp-image-373" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/A-SOCCO-Seaglider-waiting-to-be-deployed-in-the-Southern-Ocean-Credit-SOCCO.jpg" alt="A SOCCO Seaglider waiting to be deployed in the Southern Ocean (Credit: SOCCO)" width="934" height="550" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/A-SOCCO-Seaglider-waiting-to-be-deployed-in-the-Southern-Ocean-Credit-SOCCO.jpg 934w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/A-SOCCO-Seaglider-waiting-to-be-deployed-in-the-Southern-Ocean-Credit-SOCCO-300x177.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-373" class="wp-caption-text">A SOCCO Seaglider waiting to be deployed in the Southern Ocean (Credit: SOCCO)</p></div>
<p>“Our one research gap that we hope to address with these gliders, in conjunction with satellites and computer models, is better understanding the role of small scale features (such as ocean eddies and currents) and short term events (storms) on the overall state of the ocean,” says Dr. Sebastian Swart, CSIR’s principal scientist.</p>
<p>“Before glider technology was available, we were unable to measure these forms of features and variability – research ships and satellite data alone were not enough to investigate this,” he says.</p>
<h2><strong>Diving new depths</strong></h2>
<p>The first Southern Ocean glider deployments began in September 2012 near the remote Gough Island, about 2000 kilometres south west of Cape Town. For six months, gliders collected and sent data back from one of the world’s harshest environments directly to scientists at CSIR.</p>
<p>Operators based in South Africa used satellite communications to remotely control the location and depth of the robots. Since then, additional long-endurance robotics experiments have taken place in the Southern Ocean on an annual basis.</p>
<p>“Enhancing our understanding of how the Southern Ocean works and interacts with climate today will leave us in a position to better mitigate against the effects of climate change tomorrow,” says Swart.</p>
<p>The robotic glider fleet currently has nine units in total – a number that is expected to increase with the growing need of the global research community for reliable data collecting platforms that can withstand these inhospitable ocean environments. Four are surface wave gliders, which ride the ocean surface measuring CO₂, acidity, and other physical variables of the surface ocean. The other five are profiling gliders that can dive to a maximum depth of one kilometre below the ocean surface.</p>

<p>During each deployment, the gliders “tweet” data via satellite to scientists in Cape Town where it is stored, analysed and eventually made available to the global research community.</p>
<p>According to Swart, CSIR researchers are able to combine the analysis of data from surface wave and profiling gliders by pairing them together while deployed in the ocean to give a complete picture of changes in the water.</p>
<h2><strong>Tailor-made technology </strong></h2>
<p>The gliders are maintained in Cape Town at the CSIR-led South Africa Marine Engineering and Robotics Centre (SAMERC) in partnership with a marine technology company called Sea Technology Services.</p>
<p>Manufactured in the US, the gliders are modified to suit local needs when they get to South Africa.</p>
<p>“This includes adding new sensors, building new sensors for gliders and ships, refurbishing and maintaining the gliders,” says Swart who has been deeply involved in building the robotic ocean glider program in South Africa.</p>
<p>Swart says a team of South African marine engineers and engineering students at SAMERC have been trained to use the ocean gliders – a unique and advanced skill that can be expanded across the rest of the continent. A string of development programs have already been lined up. Each year young black South African engineers are trained on this advanced ocean technology, particularly the use of robots and scientific sensors. More importantly, Swart says, young marine scientists are graduating from the country’s universities.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Swart’s current team, the gliders have been instrumental in measuring ocean hydrography, chemistry and optics.</p>
<p>“More specifically they measure CO₂ exchange between the ocean and atmosphere as well as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, light levels, bio-optical properties of the water and weather such as wind, air temperature and humidity,” Swart says.</p>
<p>The gliders are sent out to collect more data from the severe Southern Ocean environment each year.</p>
<p>“We are just beginning our fourth significant Southern Ocean robotics experiment,” says Swart revealing that the research is designed to observe the full seasonal cycle of the upper ocean and its physical-biological processes.</p>
<p>Four gliders were recently deployed from the <em>SA Agulhas II</em>, South Africa’s Antarctic research vessel, in the frigid and stormy winter sea.</p>
<p>“We hope these gliders will continue making measurements until late summer time in 2016 or approximately a year in total,” he says. “They provide measurements that can be used to improve models and forecasts of the oceans and weather.”</p>
<p>Swart’s team has also conducted experiments offshore of Port Elizabeth – the site of a strong current along South Africa’s east coast. Led by CSIR’s Dr. Marjolaine Krug in April 2015, the six-week project showed that it was possible, but challenging, for the gliders to navigate and collect data in areas dominated by strong currents.</p>
<h2><strong>Boosting ocean research</strong></h2>
<p>At the University of Cape Town’s Nansen-Tutu Centre for Marine Environmental Research (MARE), research and development in ocean prediction, and using measurements of the oceans from satellites, is done.</p>
<p>Dr. Björn Backeberg, oceanographic researcher and co-director of the Nansen-Tutu Centre says that in order to predict ocean currents, ocean models must be combined with ocean observations in order to limit model errors at the nowcast stage (i.e. today), providing a better estimate of the ocean state.</p>
<p>“Ocean prediction is an initial condition problem, so if we can improve our ocean state estimate at the nowcast stage, then we improve our forecast skill for tomorrow, the day after and next week,” he says.</p>
<p>The data collected from satellites controls ocean models in a process called data assimilation, Backeberg says, satellites only measure the ocean surface, thus information about the ocean interior is missing.</p>
<p>He says that to obtain measurements of the ocean interior, researchers have historically relied on measurements gathered by ships, but this form of data collection is incredibly expensive due to the large running costs of the ships.</p>
<p>To hire the research vessel<em>, SA Agulhas II</em>, it costs approximately 300,000 rand (over 23,000 USD) a day. The daily rate for a deployed glider instead is far less – about 3,000 rand (approximately 232 USD).</p>

<p>“Robots, or autonomous platforms, such as gliders and Argo profiling floats are a much more cost effective way of collecting data, especially in remote regions that have severe weather and ocean conditions, such as the Southern Ocean,” he says.</p>
<p>Backeberg says robots are able to collect high resolution information for periods up to six months, depending on battery power, and can provide consistent data throughout the year. Keeping a ship at sea for three months is comparatively much more expensive and observations were generally more sporadic in both space and time.</p>
<p>“Assimilating these types of observations in ocean models as well as using them to validate our ocean model will help improve our ability to predict the oceans more accurately,” he adds.</p>
<h2><strong>The future of marine conservation?</strong></h2>
<p>Wider applications for these cost-effective robots are already being seen in the fields of ocean governance and resource management, and gliders are being used to monitor fish stocks and patrol the ocean for any signs of illegal activity.</p>
<p>Backeberg adds that the gliders are also beginning to assist in fish stock assessments. The information collected by these robots is providing a vital component to our understanding of fish stock health, fish migration and distribution patterns.</p>
<p>But there are limitations.</p>
<div id="attachment_380" style="width: 938px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mm.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-380" class="size-full wp-image-380" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mm.jpg" alt="A newly acquired CO2 measuring wave glider being transported in Cape Town%2c South Africa before deployment into the Subantarctic Zone (Credit: SOCCO)" width="928" height="541" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mm.jpg 928w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mm-300x175.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-380" class="wp-caption-text">A newly acquired CO2 measuring wave glider being transported in Cape Town, South Africa before deployment into the Subantarctic Zone (Credit: SOCCO)</p></div>
<p>“[The gliders] rely on acoustic measurements to estimate fish stock sizes. But acoustic measurements are unable to tell you what type of fish is being monitored. To do that you would still rely on ship measurements and stock assessment trawls,” he says.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, Backeberg backs the use of intelligent technology in conjunction with existing methods to monitor the ocean.</p>
<p>“Unmanned robots may be an important component of future marine conservation, but they will need to be used in combination with ship surveys and satellite measurements.”</p>
<p>Huge economic benefits are also in store.</p>
<p>Swart says efforts to improve ocean governance and resource management through technology will be able to feed directly into South Africa’s initiative to unlock the potential of its “blue” economy, dubbed <em>Operation Phakisa</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Phakisa</em> programme was launched in October 2014 by South African president Jacob Zuma to maximise the enormous economic potential of oceans while preserving them.</p>
<p>Ocean activity contributed 54 billion rand to South Africa’s economy and accounted for approximately 316,000 jobs in 2010, according to the government figures.</p>

<p>Home to some of the strangest (and most venomous) creatures in the ocean, the GBR is a poster child of what we stand to lose as the oceans warm. I had always wanted to see it for myself.</p>
<p>So one morning, on an ocean as flat and blue as a swimming pool, empty of other boats all the way to the cloud-strewn horizon, I hold a mask and regulator to my face and step into the water.</p>
<p>Underneath, huge mounds of coral rise 30 feet from the seafloor almost to the surface. I am surprised to find that these seamounts — called “bommies” in Aussie — are veritable catalogue advertisements of reef health and diversity. I see all kinds of <em>Acropora</em> — big, branching thickets of elkhorn, wide terraces of tabletop coral — all colored a healthy deep orange or yellow. <em>Pocillopora</em> sit on the tops of lower mounts like frilly heads of lettuce. I see enormous brain corals and tiny, fine-fingered soft corals that swayed in the current.</p>
<p>All around these pillars and buttresses, life swarms and flashes like static electricity: angelfish, damselfish, clownfish, a massive school of yellow-finned jacks winding between two bommies. There are skates bearing blue spots the size of silver dollars and parrotfish in all the colors of an 80s aerobics instructor’s leotard. Electric-blue sea stars stand out like asterisks on the sand, where giant clams flick their purple lips as I swim over.</p>
<p>If there is trouble on the Great Barrier Reef — and, by all accounts, there is — I can’t see a sign of it from behind my mask. In all its wild wholeness, this little patch of Edenic reef seems to stand both for what has been lost everywhere else, and what we stand to save.</p>
<p>But as I haul myself back out of the water — suddenly transformed back into a clumsy two-legged creature wearing sixty pounds of dive equipment and a fogged mask in front of my face — I feel both smaller and bigger than before. No matter how much I wanted to believe it while I was underwater, I knew that the idea of a pristine reef is an illusion. There are no virgin reefs to “preserve.” Any reef, any ecosystem, no matter how lovely, is in the process of being affected by the 7 billion (and counting) people of the world.</p>
<p>But that’s the way it’s always been. The reef is always changing: It is fed by currents and smashed by storms, and subject to the whims of the animals moving in waves over it.

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/coral-green.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-97 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/coral-green.jpg" alt="coral-green" width="100" height="113" /></a></p>
<p>Inside sits an array of temperature- and pH-controlled tanks, sediment pumps, and stacks of high-octane computers. With all that tech, AIMS, a federally funded research center, can feel a little like NASA, if NASA were dropped in the middle of Australia and had its laser-assisted focus retrained on the oceans. High-security access badges: Check. Brilliant, high-powered scientists: Check. Evocative acronyms: So many checks.</p>
<p>The blocky brick building I come to at the end of 50 km of wallaby-strewn highway is an unassuming advertisement for the pie-in-the-sky projects unfolding inside. And so, with not a little cognitive dissonance, I sign my name on a standard-issue clipboard, and head to the world’s first Sea Simulator — the SeaSim, for short.</p>
<p>The 10,000-square-foot facility was built with the help of a $27 million <a href="http://www.scienceinpublic.com.au/media-releases/37-million-sea-simulator">grant</a> from the Australian government (that’s $37 million in AUD) and the ambition to do the kinds of long-running, multi-variable experiments never before possible in run-of-the-mill marine biology labs.</p>
<p>The sprawling building contains an upper story with a double row of sealed rooms, each controlled by a monitor panel outside. In some, heavy-duty pumps suspend dredge sediment in tanks lit a deep dance-club blue; others hold aquariums full of crown-of-thorns starfish, nightmarish, spiny creatures whose unchecked appetites have decimated whole swaths of reef.</p>
<p>But downstairs, I find what I came for: an enormous, open-plan room that will hold the nine tanks of Madeleine van Oppen’s time machine.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/round-5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-98 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/round-5.jpg" alt="round-5" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/round-5.jpg 150w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/round-5-87x87.jpg 87w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>In February of this year,</strong> Madeleine van Oppen and her colleague Ruth Gates of the University of Hawaii published a paper suggesting that we start researching whether it’s possible for humans to help corals evolve to survive in a climate-changed world.</p>
<p>They called it “assisted evolution,” and it was a new approach to the same old problem: Corals already possess some innate resilience, but they cannot evolve fast enough to keep up with the accelerating pace of climate change. So let’s just make them evolve faster.</p>
<p>With a grant from the Paul-Allen-funded <a href="http://www.pgafamilyfoundation.org/oceanchallenge/">Ocean Challenge</a> prize, covering a five-year-long research project split between AIMS and the University of Hawaii, van Oppen and company set out to see if that’s even possible. If they could breed new generations of corals that outperformed their parents, maybe they could identify the secret to coral resilience, be it genetic, microbial, or something else altogether.</p>
<p>And for that, they need corals. A lot of them.</p>
<div style="width: 1330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/p1020361.jpg?w=1320&amp;h=742" alt="" width="1320" height="743" /><p class="wp-caption-text">AIMS staff unload samples of coral and sand from the Great Barrier Reef, to be used in SeaSim experiments.

<p><strong>The boat comes in in the afternoon.</strong> Van Oppen drives me down to the port, where researchers with a heavy crane are lifting pallets of stacked plastic bins from the deck of the dive boat into the back of a truck. It’s sunny, so they work fast — these corals have come from Davies Reef, a nearby patch of the Great Barrier, and they are likely feeling the heat.</p>
<p>As he sloshes excess seawater out of the bins, research manager Neal Cantin explains to me what they’ve brought back: entire tubs of sand and sediment, heaps of worn-down and overgrown old coral skeletons (or “live rock”), some algae and sponges for a different experiment, and, of course, about 80 coral colonies for van Oppen’s experiment.</p>
<p>The corals are the main event, but the sand and sundry are important, too. With all these ingredients — and the ambient microbial communities they host — the researchers can create a rough copy of the reef the corals just left. Then, using data from a weather tower right over Davies Reef, they can adjust the water temperature throughout the day to match natural conditions as closely as possible.</p>
<p>I hitch a ride back to the SeaSim with a couple of tubs of coral and live rock. There, in the largest chamber of the Sea Simulator, Cantin and a graduate student are arranging the corals in three long tanks, flushed with seawater and lit with full-spectrum LEDs that mimic sunshine. These tanks will serve as an indoor ocean to these corals for the next five years, or longer.</p>
<p>Eventually, there will be nine tanks in the enormous, hangar-like room, grouped by threes: One trio will be treated with water heated and cooled to match the real-time temperature data from Davies Reef. The pH levels will match normal variations the reef might experience over the course of an average day, becoming more acidic at night, in the absence of photosynthesis. The second set will have its water heated and soured to match the ocean conditions we are predicted to experience by midcentury. The third will experience the most extreme conditions, with temperatures and acidity mimicking what we might see by 2100 if climate change is left unchecked.</p>
<p>All the corals will spend a few months acclimating to these new normals. The scientists expect many of them will become stressed, even bleach — but that’s only the beginning. What they really want to find out is how the kids do.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dory.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-99 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dory.jpg" alt="dory" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dory.jpg 150w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dory-87x87.jpg 87w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The idea that humans might “assist evolution,” while it sounds wacky, is not truly anything that new.</strong> We’ve been changing the evolution of plenty of species, intentionally and otherwise, for about as long as we’ve been living in social groups. We “assist” evolution when we breed animals to perpetuate traits — milk production, for example, or docile behavior — that we find beneficial. We also can be said to assist evolution when we build environments, like cities, where certain animals, like pigeons, can find an ecological niche that never existed in the wild.</p>
<p>And we’re <em>already</em> applying selective pressures to coral. From global warming to ocean acidification, we’re changing the natural environment such that some corals are better adapted to survive than others. But evolution, while it’s happening, is not happening fast enough — and those selective pressures of ocean acidification and ocean warming run the risk of selecting reefs right out of existence.</p>
<p>Genetic selection is the most familiar kind of evolution, but the process of accumulating genetic adaptations is typically a slow one, reliant on chance mutations that occur in the right place at the right time. And corals only spawn once a year and grow slowly — which means there aren’t many chances to get things right.</p>
<p>So van Oppen’s group is looking to find the helpful mutations first, and maybe eventually find a way to spread them among wild corals. She is also looking for “epigenetic” changes in the corals, which is a catch-all term for the things that act on the genome, but are not a part of it.</p>
<p>For example, certain molecules may be attached to parts of an organism’s DNA, controlling whether a certain gene is turned on or off. If the gene is turned off, the cell won’t produce the protein that the gene codes for. In this way, an individual of a species may possess all the genes necessary to produce some trait without actually <em>expressing</em> the trait — all depending on its epigenetics.</p>
<p>These epigenetic markers have, in some cases, seemed to be heritable from a parent organism to its offspring. Van Oppen believes that epigenetics may hold the key to jump-starting corals’ non-traditional evolution in the face of warmer, more acidic waters. And if we can get a head-start on climate change by seeing what these changes might look like, maybe we can help nudge today’s reefs in the direction they need to go.</p>
<div style="width: 1330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/p1020441.jpg?w=1320&amp;h=730" alt="" width="1320" height="731" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Baby Pocillopora growing up in the SeaSim tanks. (Photo credit: Grist | Amelia Urry)</p></div>
<p><em><strong>Pocillopora</strong></em><strong> — “poss-ill-uh-pour-uh” — </strong><em><strong>acuta</strong></em><strong> are pale, knobby lumps of coral</strong>, each about the size and shape of a head of cauliflower. They are fast-growing and branching, which makes them important reef building species, not unlike the more common <em>Acropora</em>.</p>
<p>But <em>Pocillopora</em> do one weird thing differently from most other corals. Instead of spawning just once a year, <em>Pocillopora</em> can reproduce asexually, releasing fully formed clonal larvae every month or so. In van Oppen’s lab, these larvae will settle onto little ceramic discs prepared by researchers and start to grow. Some of the baby corals will be moved around — the hot future larvae back to cold present-day tanks, and vice versa — to see how they do. Then this whole step will be repeated one more time, with a third generation of corals.</p>
<p>If the second- and third-generation of corals born and raised in future ocean conditions seem robust, that may tell us about how reefs could change in real-time. But even if corals are capable of keeping up with stressfully high temperatures and acidity, they still may change in ways that will fundamentally change the reefs themselves. The corals may not grow as fast, and they may reproduce differently. Larvae might have more trouble developing, or might develop differently.</p>
<p>And if the third generation of <em>Pocillopora</em> do end up stronger than their forebearers? The next step could be one of sci-fi proportions: to take these speed-evolved corals out onto the reef. These ultra-resilient corals could potentially be used to restore damaged reefs, while providing a set of genes that could pass some of that accelerated resilience on to the next generation.</p>
<p>The other experiments van Oppen’s team will be running have some similarly stunning implications. For example, if the scientists experimentally evolve a strain of symbiotic zooxanthellae that makes its coral host more resistant to bleaching, they could conceivably grow huge tanks of it, to dump on reefs during especially hot spells.</p>
<p>To be clear, these are all pretty long shots for a lot of different reasons. But even if they’re shown to work, is it a good idea?</p>
<p><em> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rounded-4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-100 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rounded-4.jpg" alt="rounded-4" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rounded-4.jpg 150w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rounded-4-87x87.jpg 87w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></em></p>
<p><strong>“It’s not up to us in the end</strong> whether it will actually be implemented,” Madeleine van Oppen told me, before I could even ask. Her experiments are such an early step on the road to large-scale reef engineering that she only spends a few minutes talking about the possibility. For van Oppen, the important thing is that we at least start asking the right questions. Answering them is a whole different research project.</p>
<p>What we definitely don’t want to do, she says, is to introduce new problems into a system we’ve already thrown out of whack. “We are very good at messing things up, changing this planet tremendously,” van Oppen says. “We’re also very innovative and intelligent, I suppose. We’ve come up with lots of good solutions.”</p>
<p>One thing is sure: We’ll have to put the brakes on climate change eventually, if we want to stave off disaster — on this point, everyone agrees. But even if we phase out greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10 or 20 years, the atmosphere and oceans will continue to warm for years after — so we need to be prepared to deal with that.</p>
<p>In a certain light, this crisis is nothing new for humans, says van Oppen: “We pollute the environment and then we clean it up. We develop bacteria that can digest hydrocarbons when there’s been an oil spill. It’s no different from other things where we clean up after the mess we have made. We do that all the time. Unfortunately, that’s how humans are.”</p>
<p>I’m starting to get the sense that if scientists, governments, and nonprofits can figure out how to engineer a better coral reef, it will be because, in the end, it’s easier to change nature itself than it is to change human nature.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="corals-sectionheadlink text-center" style="text-align: center"><a href="/coral-reefs-are-in-trouble-meet-the-people-trying-to-rebuild-them/">Part 1</a> | <strong>Part 2</strong> | <a href="/coral-restoration-part-3-evolution/">Part 3</a></p>
<h2 class="corals-sectionhead text-center" style="text-align: center">Selection</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/coral.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/coral.png" alt="coral" width="100" height="113" /></a></p>
<p>Under the intense heat of the southern sun, in a shallow lagoon where water temperatures can reach 95 degrees F, coral reefs are thriving. While corals elsewhere struggle when water temperatures reach the mid-80s, these equatorial corals can handle the extra degrees without breaking a sweat. Those are the kinds of water temperatures people expect to see by the end of this century, which means, in a sense, Ofu’s corals are already living in the future.</p>
<p>Marine biologist Steve Palumbi wants to find out how these corals are so chill about extreme heat. A researcher at Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station, Palumbi wanted to know if these outlying “supercorals” could hold the key to a secret resiliency available to all corals.</p>
<p>“Corals live in a very variable environment and they have for millions of years,” Palumbi tells me one afternoon, in his office in Monterey, Calif. “So it stands to reason that perhaps, in corals that live right now, there are already some that have adapted to live in future environments.”</p>
<div style="width: 1330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ofu_coral.jpg?w=1320&amp;h=742" alt="" width="1320" height="743" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Thickets of coral growing in the super-heated water off of Ofu, in American Samoa.Dan Griffin, Garthwaite Griffin Films</p></div>
<p>So Palumbi took a team of researchers and students to Ofu to put the supercorals through their paces. He chose to focus on a type of <em>Acropora</em> — the same genus that includes elkhorn and staghorn corals — called tabletop corals. As their name suggests, they grow in broad, table-like ledges, gathering as much solar energy as they can and providing shelter and shade for other species.</p>
<p>Fast-growing and generally susceptible to heat extremes, <em>Acropora</em> are both a fundamental builder of reef architecture and usually one of the more fragile species on the reef. If Ofu’s tabletops seemed hardier than usual, Palumbi was determined to find out why.</p>
<p>Using portable water coolers (the kind you’d use to stash a couple six-packs at a picnic) rigged with heating and refrigerating elements, the researchers took fragments of coral from the reef and subjected them to a uniform battery of stress tests. As the temperatures inched up, and the corals became more and more stressed, they started to expel the photosynthetic algae they need to live, and eventually bleached.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s interesting: The corals the researchers chose for testing came from different parts of the same reef, some of which experienced much higher temperatures on a regular basis. These “warm-adjusted” corals were much less likely to bleach under high temperatures than those that came from cooler parts of the reef.</p>
<p><iframe width="760" height="428" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/--XHZZKu-ac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>There are two mechanisms by which these corals (or any organism really) can adjust to an extreme environment — increased temperatures, for example. </strong>The first, acclimation, is a short-term process whereby individual organisms change their physiology to become more heat tolerant. Then there’s adaptation, the longer-term process of natural selection whereby certain individuals pass on the genetic traits that make them more successful in warmer environments.</p>
<p>In other words: Acclimation is the tan you get on vacation, while adaptation is the skin tone you’re born with. In both cases, having more pigment in your skin reduces your risk of getting sunburned. So an organism’s life history might approximate some of the advantages of a genetic predisposition, through different mechanisms.</p>
<p>With corals, the combination of the two factors is more powerful than either on its own. To test this, Palumbi’s team transplanted corals from the cooler part of the reef to the warmest pool. They left them there for three years, after which the researchers subjected them to the same set of stress tests they’d undergone three years earlier, raising the temperature to an extreme level for several days at a time.</p>
<p>This time, the cool-adapted corals that had spent the last three years acclimating in warm pools did noticeably better than their cold-water clones. But the original warm-pool corals still outperformed their acclimated cousins, suggesting some older genetic advantage was also at work.</p>
<p>The next step, Palumbi says, is to start trying to use these supercorals to help corals in general. To that end, his PhD student, Megan Morikawa, is establishing a coral nursery off the coast of Ofu, where she hopes to cultivate the most resilient, heat-tolerant corals they find. Like Nedimyer, they want to replenish reefs with corals, and with the genetic diversity that will allow them to survive in a range of environments.</p>
<p>It’s too early to know if this will work. Palumbi is hopeful that something can be done, but aware of the challenges in scaling this kind of experiment up to a level where it can actually be effective.</p>
<p>“You can’t go to a replanted reef,” he says in his office, thousands of miles away from Ofu. “You can go to a replanted forest, but as of now, there is no replanted reef.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When a coral bleaches, it doesn’t necessarily die</strong> — which means some interesting things can happen after a bleaching event sweeps a reef.</p>
<p>A coral polyp gathers some of its food from the water current, but it gets most of its energy by harvesting the sun’s energy, using tiny algae called zooxanthellae that live inside its cells. As the water heats up, those little algae start to produce chemicals that irritate the coral cells. As these so-called “free radicals” build-up, they start to damage the cell until the coral polyp gets so agitated it expels most or all of its zooxanthellae.</p>
<p>From then, the coral polyp is essentially on its own. It loses the pigment it gets from its symbiont algae, turning pale white, and loses the energy it gets from photosynthesis. Without that energy, the coral feeds on its reserves and strains what food it can get from the water column. It stops growing and is at risk of eventually starving to death.</p>
<p>If the temperature drops again, the polyp can take up new zooxanthellae from the water and keep growing as before. But the longer the coral stays bleached, the less likely it will be able to recover.</p>
<p>However, there is a secondary effect to all this bleaching and unbleaching, which Palumbi and others have seized on as a possible source of hope. After a coral has bleached once, the next time it is subjected to abnormally high temperatures, it is much less likely to succumb.</p>
<p>In the same El Niño season that wiped out Florida’s corals, the reefs around the tiny island nation of Palau bleached <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003380100151">extensively</a>. Today, nearly 10 years later, they have almost completely recovered, Palumbi says. In fact, at this point most reefs in the world have bleached, he says. And a good number of them have recovered.</p>
<p>So corals are resilient, maybe more than we thought, and can recover from near-fatal events. But how fast can they keep up? In all their history — and at <a href="http://www.coris.noaa.gov/about/what_are/">400 million years</a>, it’s a long one — the organisms have never experienced a rate of change like what they are subjected to today.</p>
<p>What’s more, a coral’s vulnerability to and recovery from bleaching have a lot to do with the presence of other stressors, Palumbi points out. With pollution, habitat destruction, overfishing, sedimentation, and so on, what would be a tolerable amount of climate change can become an intolerable amount.</p>
<p>In this sense, Ofu is a lucky place to be a coral. Sure, the corals living in the sheltered lagoons of the remote island may have to put up with 95 degrees F — but they don’t have to deal with many humans.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tendrils.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-142 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tendrils.jpg" alt="tendrils" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tendrils.jpg 150w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tendrils-87x87.jpg 87w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Corals can adapt and acclimate to higher temperatures — but only to a point.</strong> Even Palumbi’s supercorals, subjected to monstrously high temperatures in the stress tanks, have a limit. Eventually, given enough global warming, the world’s reefs will find their limits, too.</p>
<p>“I can’t do everything,” Palumbi admits. “But if I can just help keep the ocean alive long enough for us to wean ourselves off of fossil fuels, we can make it.”</p>
<p>This summer, Palumbi brought 80 corals back from Ofu, small fragments from the different genotypes and environments he was hoping to test in the lab. Then all but two of the corals died when he got them to the lab, and they took their heat-resisting secrets with them. Palumbi will have to go back to the reef and start over. But he’s determined to find the corals of the world that possess the superpower to resist higher ocean temperatures, and protect them.</p>
<p>“Saving the ocean for the next 85 years — that’s a pretty good job,” he says. “I just need to show people that it is worth it.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idyllic Pacific Northwest has long been a seafood-oriented place. Surrounded by water and mountainscapes, you can see its reliance on seafood running all the way back to ancient Native American ceremonies and totems. Today, Seattle is home to much of the Alaska fishing fleet, and Washington and Oregon are healthy producers of oysters, Dungeness crab, geoduck, and other prized seafood.</p>
<p>However, in the late 2000s, that way of life was called into question when ocean acidification turned up on the scene: causing massive die-offs of very young oyster larvae, called “seed.” While the ocean is alkaline, and will always be that way, ocean acidification is the term used to describe the process of the ocean gradually becoming more acidic due to absorption of carbon dioxide (C0<sub>2</sub>) emissions. Nearly a third of carbon emissions released into the atmosphere are absorbed by the ocean. Once upon a time people thought that was a good thing: that the ocean was doing us a favor, and there would be no additional consequences. Well, that fantasy is over.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the addition of C0<sub>2</sub> has been fundamentally changing the chemistry of seawater. These changes are illustrated twofold: first, the pH of the ocean is gradually decreasing. Healthy seawater has a pH of 8.1, but since the output of anthropogenic (human-caused) carbon emissions began, a .11 decrease in the global average pH of the surface ocean has been observed. The pH scale is logarithmic, which means a pH decrease of .11 is actually a 30% increase in acidity (a change more rapid than any observed in the last 300 million years). In some places, like the Pacific Northwest, the change to seawater has been even more dramatic, due to the upwelling of carbon-rich, deep ocean water to the surface each year, which exacerbates the effects of ocean acidification (OA). The pH can be as low as 7.5 in certain “hot-spots.”</p>
<p>Secondly, the addition of CO<sub>2</sub> to the ocean causes a harmful chemical reaction. Carbon dioxide binds with water and carbonate ions to produce bicarbonate. For creatures that rely on plentiful carbonate to build their shells (like oysters, clams, shrimp, mussels, crab, and others), this change to the chemistry compromises their ability to do so.</p>
<div id="attachment_31" style="width: 483px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Scanning-Electron-Microscope-image-of-oyster-larvae-damage-from-OA-courtesy-of-OSU.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31" class="wp-image-31 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Scanning-Electron-Microscope-image-of-oyster-larvae-damage-from-OA-courtesy-of-OSU.jpg" alt="In these scanning electron microscope images by Elizabeth Brunner and Dr. George Waldbusser of Oregon State University, Pacific oyster larvae from the Taylor Shellfish Hatchery are shown affected by acidic, unfavorable chemistry of ocean water (right) compared to healthy larvae of the same age raised in favorable water chemistry. The scientists say the images show signs of impaired shell growth, defects, and creases and suggestions of the shells being dissolved. From the very first day of their life, oysters begin to build shells using just the energy in their yolks, and that can be inhibited by acidity and cause the shell buiding may fail. The first few days of growth are crucial, Waldbusser told news media: &quot;They must build their first shell quickly on a limited amount of energy--and along with the shell comes the organ to capture external food,&quot; said Waldbusser. The unfavorable ocean water has high amounts of pCO2 (determined by dissolved CO2 and carbonic acid), and low concentration of aragonite, the kind of calcium carbonate used by shellfish to grow their shells. Such water conditions occur at Dabob Bay, home of the Taylor hatchery and Netarts Bay, OR, where the Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery is located. Whiskey Creek was a close collaborator in recent research by Waldbusser, Brunner and colleagues, showing how oysters are affected by ocean changes brought on by CO2 emissions.

<p>Multiplying the effects of OA are other changing ocean conditions, such as warming, nutrient runoff, pollution, and disease. Known as multi-stressor scenarios, when these conditions combine – as they often do in the Pacific – it can create a domino effect of weakening marine foodwebs and organisms’ health. As Eric Sanford, professor of evolution and ecology at the University of California, Davis and lead author on a study of OA combined with other stressors, said, &#8220;You might decide to go to work if you had a toothache. But what if you had a toothache, the flu, and a broken leg? At some point, multiple stressors will cause natural systems to break down.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Oysters Become the “Canary in the Coal Mine”</strong></h2>
<p>Before local seawater chemistry turned against them, most oyster farmers in estuaries along the coast of the Northwest relied at least partially on wild seed – the oysters in the estuary would spawn and the seed would settle on old shells and other rough surfaces, “set” there, and the growers would tend them until ready for harvest. Many growers also supplemented with seed from hatcheries, which pump in seawater to breed and sustain large tanks of oyster larvae, and then sell it in varying sizes and quantities to growers who want to boost their numbers.</p>
<p>While OA had been a subject of scientific study for some time, conditions were not expected to harm marine organisms until 2050, and back in 2007, the term “ocean acidification” was known to only a small circle.</p>
<p>That is, until something started happening at Whiskey Creek Hatchery, in Netarts Bay, Oregon, which had been farming oysters commercially for over 150 years, and provides over 3000 family wage jobs in rural areas along the coastline. After 30 years of consistent production of oyster larvae, in 2007 and 2008 they started experiencing losses that reduced production substantially and unsustainably. As hatchery manager Alan Barton says, “The bottleneck in supply always has been and always will be producing enough larvae to meet the needs of our growers. Now that we’re having problems producing larvae in our hatchery, it’s already had a pretty big economic impact on our industry, to the tune of tens of millions of dollars per year in lost harvested product.”</p>
<div id="attachment_30" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Alan-Barton-pic.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30" class="wp-image-30 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Alan-Barton-pic-765x1024.jpg" alt="Whiskey Creek Hatchery manager Alan Barton " width="760" height="1017" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Alan-Barton-pic-765x1024.jpg 765w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Alan-Barton-pic-224x300.jpg 224w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Alan-Barton-pic-598x800.jpg 598w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Alan-Barton-pic.jpg 1936w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-30" class="wp-caption-text">Whiskey Creek Hatchery manager Alan Barton</p></div>
<p>The usual suspects, like disease, were ruled out, and funding was collected to bring scientists in to identify the problem. They concluded that ocean acidification was to blame. The combination of carbon and nutrient rich deep ocean water upwelling along the west coast and carbon dioxide emissions absorbed from the atmosphere had caused a tipping point. Every year since this discovery, from California to British Columbia, monitoring systems have consistently documented water corrosive enough to dissolve fragile young larval shells, and it affects every grower and every hatchery along that coastline. At the same time, wild sets of oyster seed ceased to be available because they died in the first 48 hours of spawning. This made oyster farmers entirely reliant on hatcheries, and many growers had to invest in costly capital equipment like larval setting tanks, increasing expenses by 30% or more a year.</p>
<p>Before Barton experienced all of this for himself, he was the last person to call himself an environmentalist, and didn’t have a particular stance on climate change. The concepts, he says, are complicated to understand, but critical for his industry going forward. “It nearly drove us out of business in 2009, and continues to have a big economic impact on our industry. Thanks to monitoring we’re able to find times of years that are safer to spawn, and thanks to sophisticated water treatment systems, we can treat our hatchery water to maintain healthy production.”</p>
<p>According to Barton, Whiskey Creek installed automatic buffering systems in 2011 in order to maintain a constant pH in the hatchery. But even he admits it’s only a short term fix. “Every year we can see it getting harder to fix the water. And every year our production changes as a result of that,” he says. “We want to work in the hatchery and produce larvae. But we’re forced to start thinking about the global problem of CO2 emissions, because we have no other option. Some of you guys might not like oysters, but food webs that affect salmon, cod, crab, shrimp, and lots of other important seafood is also at risk.”</p>
<p>The life-long oysterman reiterates that he’s not an environmentalist, but the problems facing his industry require action on a larger scale. “If we continue down the road that we’re on, in terms of emissions, there won’t be oyster farmers by the turn of the century,” he says. “We have often been referred to as the canary in the coal mine, but if you’re familiar with the history of that phrase, the canary has to die so that everyone else can make it out safe. We don’t want to be the canary in the coal mine. It’s time to make some hard decisions that can keep us going in the future.”</p>
<p>For now, west coast hatcheries use expensive real-monitoring water monitoring systems that detect when seawater conditions are harmful, and add sodium carbonate to buffer it sufficiently to protect delicate larvae. But as Barton mentioned, it is becoming more difficult each year and none feel confident of a long-term future. For family-owned businesses in their fourth and fifth generations, this is a real blow. For them, oyster farming is a way of life and they can’t imagine spending their days any other way.</p>
<h2><strong>King Crab on the Hook</strong></h2>
<p>Another iconic seafood, the red king crab, looks to be vulnerable to OA, and stakeholders are scrambling to find a solution. One group is looking to hatcheries as a partial fix. Now for the first time, hatchery-reared juvenile red king crab have been released into the wild, and results are back on the viability of restocking areas where populations have been devastated, or where future OA hot-spots may kill young red king crab, which have proven to be particularly susceptible to OA conditions.</p>
<div id="attachment_25" style="width: 534px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Baby-crab-by-Alutiq-Hatchery-e1448071641386.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25" class="wp-image-25 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Baby-crab-by-Alutiq-Hatchery-e1448071641386.jpg" alt="Baby crab by Alutiq Hatchery" width="524" height="600" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Baby-crab-by-Alutiq-Hatchery-e1448071641386.jpg 524w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Baby-crab-by-Alutiq-Hatchery-e1448071641386-262x300.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-25" class="wp-caption-text">Baby red king crab (Photo credit: Alutiq Hatchery)</p></div>
<p>A 2013 <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0060959">report</a> shows that red king crab juveniles experience 100% mortality rates when exposed to pH 7.5 for 95 days. While the Pacific Northwest regularly experiences such conditions, Alaskan waters are still generally in the healthy range of 8.0 pH, for now. But Robert Foy, one of the authors of the report, predicts natural breeding and successful survival of red king crab to fail within 20-30 years of Alaskan waters reaching pH 7.8 (expected within 30 years). The <em>Seattle Times</em> <a href="http://apps.seattletimes.com/reports/sea-change/2013/sep/11/alaska-crab-industry/">reported on the study</a> and its implications last year in their award-winning Sea Change series.</p>
<p>These potentially dangerous conditions, however, might not be as far in the future as we thought. Jeremy Mathis, a well-known OA researcher for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), found disturbing evidence about current conditions: “What we actually found is that in certain times of the year, the [pH] conditions near the bottom in the Bering Sea <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064513002932">were actually worse</a> than the conditions that Bob was raising his crabs under [in the lab].” Fortunately, there’s no evidence that OA is currently affecting wild populations; the critical times when Mathis’ study found the sea to be most corrosive happen during a part of the crab life cycle when they are not as vulnerable. However, there’s no denying that stocks are dwindling and have been for some time &#8211; even in places where fishing has been banned -but a specific cause has yet to be isolated.</p>
<p>Red king crab is a lucrative fishery, and many fortunes have been built on it over the last century. You see its iconic image reflected all over the Northwest and Alaska, and real estate investments born from king crab money abound today in both areas. At Seattle’s famous Pike Place market, king crab can command as much as $39.99 a pound. In addition to its delicious flesh, the fishery itself became hugely popular through the reality TV show “Deadliest Catch,” which exposed audiences to the dangerous nature and the emotional highs and lows of crab fishing. But for those who rely on healthy king crab stocks for their living, particularly those who own quota and fishing vessels, the look at the future predicted by this OA research is troubling. For many multi-generational fishing families, there’s a strong chance that their children and grandchildren will not be able to carry on the crab fishing legacy. Adding that in some places king crab stocks are already down from historic levels, as well as threatened by other issues like warming seas, some in the industry felt compelled to act by forming new partnerships. Others are diversifying to other fisheries, while still others are continuing with business as usual. Jim Stone, co-owner of a Bering Sea crab vessel, the <em>F/V Arctic Hunter</em>, told the <em>Seattle Times</em>, “We’re scared to death, but we’ve heard a lot of horror stories before.”</p>
<p>Seeking to get ahead of the curve is the Alaska King Crab Research, Rehabilitation and Biology program (AKCRRAB), a joint program supported by industry, natives, Alaskan communities, and state and federal programs. Their attention turned to an experiment led by Alutiq Pride Shellfish Hatchery, which had already been underway for some years, to restock crab populations around Kodiak Island where levels had crashed forty years ago. That experiment took on a new meaning and garnered new attention with the threat of ocean acidification.</p>
<p>Alutiq Pride Shellfish Hatchery is at the center of rearing crab larvae, they’ve spent years learning how to do it as part of the Kodiak restocking effort. Along with producing stocks of oysters, geoducks, abalone, butter clams, and sea cucumbers, they also raise juvenile red and blue king crab larvae. Crab fishing vessels help the hatchery collect pregnant females, and Alutiq Pride raises broodstock on site. Now the result of years of experimentation is coming to fruition, with the successful outplanting of hatchery-reared crab into the wild.</p>
<p>Broodstock collected from Alitak Bay in fall of 2013 was reared until August 2014, when 11,250 red king crab juveniles were released into experimental 5&#215;5 meter plots in Trident Basin, near Kodiak, Alaska. Their survival in the wild has been carefully tracked since the time of release, with varied trial crab densities and predator density monitored. At the last reporting, AKCCRAB found that after 65% die-off in the first 24 hours (similar to losses in other hatchery-reared animals released into the wild) survival rates of hatchery-reared crab are about the same as that of wild juveniles – supporting the theory that artificially restocking the area is ecologically viable. After that initial mortality, the loss rate of hatchery crab and wild populations equalized, indicating that outplanting works and that future releases of juveniles could be made in higher numbers.</p>
<p>Three more outplantings took place this year, and mortality and efficiency are increasing with each attempt. Alutiq began the year with 400,000 red king crab larvae and 15,000 blue king crab larvae in March, when larvae hatching was underway. Such large numbers are necessary to start, because cannibalism is rampant among hatchery reared juveniles – as many as 50% are lost with each molting. Larvae from numerous females are being utilized to preserve genetic diversity in the stock. They can also do full parental genotyping, so progeny can always be traced back to the mother. Larvae are fed on algae until they molt into the first juvenile stage. In each round of outplanting, AKCCRAB experimented with variables to increase survival: like releasing crabs of different sizes, and releasing at night when the threat from predators could be lower. NOAA teams will continue to monitor all of the released juveniles through the winter, until March 2016.</p>
<p>These experiments indicate significant progress for Alutiq Pride and AKCCRAB. The project has brought together collaborators from across the board: the fishing industry, tribal interests, Alaskan communities, and organizations from both state and local government. At long last the project is bearing fruit, and there’s some hope in the use of hatchery-reared king crab to support natural stocks. Hatchery manager Jeff Hetrick says, “The big picture is reestablishing stocks, but we’re also learning techniques and technology that are pretty amazing.”</p>
<p>Now that multiple experimental releases have proved successful, Hetrick says, “Alutiq Pride can start ramping up production, releasing a couple hundred thousand next year.” That will be the final year of experimentation. After that, they will be using the technology to take the project to the next level and actively reestablish crab stocks.</p>
<p>But nobody believes that hatcheries can fully replace wild populations of red king crab. The amount of juveniles needed to populate the Bering Sea alone boggles the mind. “We’re hoping that it never gets to the point that they rely on the hatchery for that kind of work,” Hetrick says. “If we get to that point I think we’re in trouble. But it is a possibility.” However, perfecting the science might help restock populations in devastated areas, and the industry can be ahead of the curve in hatchery-rearing king crab as the pH continues to drop in ocean waters around the world. Hetrick adds, “With what we’ve learned in the last few years, ocean chemistry is changing rapidly for the worse, and the work that we’re doing is vital for sustaining crab populations.”</p>

<p>Just as oyster growers in the Pacific Northwest now rely solely on hatchery-reared oyster seed while the rest of the world can count on wild sets, it might be that future Alaskan OA hot-spots will need some help from hatcheries to support crab populations. While AKCCRAB is hoping that we never see that future, they are leading the fishing industry by getting the heavy lifting of the science perfected <em>before</em> mortality events catch them off guard.</p>
<h2><strong>A Strand of Hope</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ecy.wa.gov/water/marine/oceanacidification.html">The Washington State Blue Ribbon Panel on Ocean Acidification</a> was formed by Governor Christine Gregoire in 2012 to identify potential OA adaptation, mitigation, and remediation actions. One of the most promising is the use of vegetation, like eelgrass and kelp, to help “sweeten” the water. When plants photosynthesize, they absorb carbon dioxide from the water, and cause the seawater’s pH to go up. This action is called phytoremediation. A lot of research is currently underway to investigate its efficacy in creating “OA refugia.” The idea of an OA refuge is that certain small geographical areas could, through the use of naturally occurring materials, create a small halo area where OA is reduced or even eliminated.</p>
<p>Betsy Peabody, of the Puget Sound Restoration Fund, speaks about a recent grant they received from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation to investigate the use of kelp for OA remediation. When asked if she believes that the seaweed project will produce enough of a change to seawater chemistry to create an OA refuge, Peabody said: “Everyone on the project team feels like if there is an effect it will certainly be localized, but the important point is that it is replicable. It can be used to help mitigate OA hot-spots. Hopefully, we’ll see that a kelp cultivation array will reduce nitrogen and carbon locally, plus provide other ecosystem services. The concept of refuges is really important, we have to find ways to improve and maintain conditions for important calcifiers [oysters, clams, crab, mussels].”</p>
<p>At the same time, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources and the University of Washington have been investigating the changes in pH that the presence of eelgrass creates. They established experiments at five sites, and found that while photosynthesizing, eelgrass raised the pH at a rate of .05 units per hour. Areas with eelgrass also maintained a higher pH at night (when not photosynthesizing).</p>
<p>This gives some promise for the hope of mitigating the effects of OA in the short term, in the areas that need it most – economically and ecologically valuable sites, or in certain “hot-spots.” But until carbon emissions are drastically reduced globally, seafood is on a slippery slope. Ocean acidification legislation has been lucky to find bipartisan support in a way that climate change generally does not, and seven coastal states have now addressed OA through expert panels, task forces, or other state legislation. In the big picture though, seafood producers are left wondering if there will be a future for the next generation.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>From the boat, there’s nothing remarkable about the place — just choppy water and a white mooring ball, a few miles off Key Largo.

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/reef.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-101 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/reef.jpg" alt="reef" width="100" height="79" /></a></p>
<p>This is a coral nursery. Each tree bears a ripening crop of a hundred or more pieces of coral. The smallest fragments are pinkie-sized, twirling on their tethers as other divers kick by; the largest hang like many-limbed chandeliers, turning slowly in the current. When I get closer, I can see the individual polyps, the anemone-like creatures that make up each fragmented colony. Nestled in the crenellated openings in their solid skeletons, they are waving their fleshy tentacles through the water, feeding.</p>
<p>We are there to tend the trees: Each one needs to be surveyed, scrubbed of algae, and have its biggest corals subdivided into new cuttings. Any coral bleached by high temperatures or damaged by disease needs to be removed to a nearby heap. This is a daunting task considering that the Coral Restoration Foundation (CRF) maintains five coral nurseries with some 40,000 corals growing on trees just like these ones, all along the spattered arc of the Florida Keys.</p>
<p>Exaggerating her gestures, a woman named Patty shows us — a group of long-time volunteers and visiting divers — how to hang new cuttings in place of the corals we cut down. We exhale long streamers of air back toward the surface, and move slowly as we pass the shared pliers around, cutting and crimping monofilament with the slow-motion care of astronauts maneuvering in zero gravity.</p>
<p>I pick up a piece of coral, maybe eight inches long and forked at both ends. It’s a deep amber, except for the bright white tips of its branches. It’s hard to tell how heavy an object is underwater, but this one feels light: A small thing to pin the reef’s future on. I tag it with the name and number of its tree, and drop it into a milk crate with the others we’ve harvested.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to go plant a reef.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rounded-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-94 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rounded-2.jpg" alt="rounded-2" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rounded-2.jpg 150w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rounded-2-87x87.jpg 87w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I got here with a question:</strong> What happens to coral reefs as the ocean warms and acidifies over the coming century? Corals might seem removed from human society, but in fact that not-so-simple question leads to an even scarier follow-up: What happens to us?</p>
<p>Coral reefs are the richest ocean ecosystems we have — they support an estimated 25 percent of marine species. According to <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3720e.pdf">a 2014 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization</a>, reefs are responsible for 17 percent of the protein we consume globally; in some coastal or island countries, like Sierra Leone or the Maldives, that number can be as high as 70 percent. Reefs serve as offshore larders, nurseries for important commercial fish (like tuna), and shelter for important ecological species (like sharks). They’re storm breaks for populated shores and bait for tourists whose dollars support entire local economies.</p>
<p>We know that reefs are crucial to the oceans as we know them, and to our societies as we’ve made them — and we know they are in serious trouble. According to one 2000 report, <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Coral/">we’ve lost</a> 27 percent of coral worldwide, and stand to lose another 32 percent in the next 30 years.</p>
<p>What we don’t know is if there’s anything we can do about it. Luckily, that won’t stop people from trying: Around the world, a scrappy handful of scientists, entrepreneurs, and volunteers are taking on this colossal problem, one branch at a time.</p>
<p>From regrowing the reefs we’ve already lost to engineering new corals that may be able to survive hotter, more acidic seas, these innovators are fighting everything from nutrient pollution to overfishing to discarded fishing nets to ocean warming itself. If we want to succeed, we might have to learn how to rewrite an entire ecosystem from the bottom up.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Making impactful, visual indicators of our changing climate isn’t an easy task. Climate change is a gradual process, so it’s difficult to visibly show people what’s happening. Our oceans are changing, but we don’t notice the centimeter waters have risen or the amount they’re acidifying. But coral bleaching and reef decline are capturable: There are stark visual differences between thriving coral reefs and ones that have bleached as a result of warming oceans.</p>

<div style="width: 784px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/coral2.png" alt="" width="774" height="371" /><p class="wp-caption-text">American Samoa, April 2015 (Photo credit: XL Catlin Seaview Survey)</p></div>
<p><a href="http://underwaterearth.org/#page-1">Underwater Earth’s XL Catlin Seaview Survey</a> is making stunning panoramic images of coral reefs. Think of it as the oceanic version of Google Street View. With hundreds of thousands of photos taken already, the survey is globally documenting reef health and making the data it’s collecting along the way widely available to the public. Corals are declining one to two percent each year, so photographing this loss could help the world see what’s at stake.</p>
<p>Founded in 2010 by a group of former advertisers, Underwater Earth’s mission is to increase ocean literacy by taking captivating images of the world’s reefs. “Our goal was to collect ocean imagery to engage people in ways there weren’t possible before,” says Richard Vevers, Executive Director of the XL Catlin Seaview Survey and CEO of Underwater Earth.</p>
<p>People pause when they see these images–they understand that a white reef looks empty. Photos of ghostly white coral skeletons in American Samoa captured public attention earlier this year. The survey recorded a healthy reef there in December 2014 and then came back a few months later to document an extensively bleached one.</p>
<div id="attachment_20" style="width: 445px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasurvey.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20" class="wp-image-20" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasurvey-300x187.png" alt="seasurvey" width="435" height="271" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasurvey-300x187.png 300w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasurvey.png 643w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-20" class="wp-caption-text">Flowerpot Rocks, American Samoa, December 2014 (left) and February 2015 (right); (Photo credit: XL Catlin Seaview Survey)</p></div>
<p>“Oceans are like a veneer that provides us with life on earth. It’s oxygen, food, and weather–that’s why people need to understand the implications of ocean change,” says Vevers. Up to 80 percent of carbon dioxide could be absorbed by oceans, so they really are the focal point of climate change.</p>
<p>By working with Google, the largest online communicator, the photos are now the most viewed underwater images in history. Some have been viewed by millions of people after being linked to Google’s homepage. The survey has taken over 750,000 images in 26 countries, but Google hosts a smaller curation of the panoramas on <a href="http://www.google.com/maps/streetview/#oceans">Oceans Street View</a>.</p>
<p>“Google provides a platform for organizations like Underwater Earth, NOAA and Mission Blue, who know the stories and issues best, to use our technology to tell their story,” says Jenifer Austin, manager of Google’s Ocean Program.</p>
<p>The survey is funded by the specialty insurance group XL Catlin. It’s no surprise that insurance companies are paying close attention to the effects of climate change given the economic costs of more frequent and intense natural disasters.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m0!3m2!1sen!2sfr!4v1448384619751!6m8!1m7!1socgCD5dOU64AAAQo8A3lQQ!2m2!1d-14.2591333161759!2d-169.5003055184385!3f180.52024213220255!4f-11.97090933730766!5f0.4000000000000002&amp;w=600&amp;h=450" height="450" width="100%"></iframe></p>
<p>To create each panoramic image, divers take a photo every two meters and can cover about 6 kilometers each day. Three images are taken simultaneously to get the 360 degree panoramic photos all while recording metadata like temperature, time, depth, and coordinates. Once the data is processed over the course of a few weeks, it can be uploaded to the Underwater Earth website using the <a href="http://www.google.com/maps/about/partners/businessview/apply/">Google Business photography program</a>.</p>
<p>They’re taking more than just pretty pictures, though. A technology similar to facial recognition systems that was developed by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography can assess the health of corals in each image. Without that technology, it could take a person months to go through as many images and it would be less precise than the 90 percent accuracy the recognition system has. What’s more is that all of the data collected about reef conditions is publicly <a href="http://globalreefrecord.org/data">available online</a>, so scientists can use it anytime.</p>
<p>Since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch program released its predictive bleaching tools this year, the survey has the ability to photograph a reef before and then after a major bleaching event. Coral Reef Watch sounds the alarm with its predictive maps up to months in advance and the survey goes in to take a firsthand look at the bleaching. Field scientists can then layer data about local conditions on these images to share information about what’s happening to the reef.</p>
<p>Closely watching these bleached reefs has scientific value too. By documenting resilient reefs with high recovery rates, scientists can show that reefs have a better chance of survival when human stressors are limited. Local managers can then use the images and data analysis to gain support for marine conservation.</p>
<p>“Better management and marine policy allows us to buy enough time for reefs to potentially repopulate and adapt. That’s the real reason we need measures in place to control local conditions,” says Vevers. “If we continue business as usual, we’ll lose most corals by 2050.”</p>
<p>What’s next for the CSS? For now they’re working on documenting all six coral reef regions in the world and then revisiting them every four to five years to see how they’re changing. If there’s a big storm, such as a major cyclone in the Great Barrier Barrier Reef, they’ll go assess the damage. Underwater robots might come somewhere down the line too.</p>
<p>Underwater Earth and Google are also working on more outreach. They’re setting up educational programs to take school children, media professionals, and stakeholders on virtual dives–places they might not otherwise see. The imagery is already being used in classrooms with <a href="https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/">Google Expeditions</a>.</p>
<p>“The potential of this partnership is huge. That a small non-profit partner could leverage our mapping technology to reach a large global audience and millions of people is unparalleled,” says Austin.</p>
<p><iframe width="760" height="428" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4C5EGXqgx8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>It’s clear Underwater Earth is raising public awareness about coral bleaching and the importance of reefs to livelihoods. And, partnering with Google has certainly furthered the reach of the project and might help lead to future policy changes too. To gain support for marine conservation, world leaders must be able to see what’s at risk if we don’t limit human stressors. Underwater Earth is providing the visuals to do just that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s a test. Try to list five reasons why the oceans are important to life on earth. It may get a bit difficult when you are down to reason number four or five. Now, describe how the things you just listed would be affected by CO<sub>2</sub> emissions caused by human activities. You may think that I am expecting too much from you. I am not. These facts are as important as knowing why water is essential to the world and how polluting it would affect us.</p>
<p>The global ocean is vast and so is the diversity of organisms that call it home. It covers 71% of the Earth’s surface, housing hundreds of thousands of species. In fact, it is essential for the survival of humans and other organisms on land as it is critical in regulating the earth’s climate to make it hospitable for us. Marine ecosystems also provide other essential goods and services such as food and coastal protection and are an integral component of my culture.</p>
<p>The oceans contribute tremendously to moderating the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on the climate, although this is achieved with great costs. In a recent paper published in <em>Science,</em> my colleagues and I summarized these benefits and costs. While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that the warming of the Earth’s surface is caused by human CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the global ocean has already done a tremendous service to us by absorbing 93% of the additional heat caused by these emissions since the 1970s. The ocean also has captured 28% of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted from our (and our ancestor’s) activities since 1750. Thus, without these moderating effects from the oceans, climate change would have been much more severe by now.</p>
<p>The absorption of heat and CO<sub>2</sub> substantially alters the physical and chemical properties of the oceans, which in turn has large effects on marine organisms. The heat warms up the ocean, reducing the amount of oxygen context, and the CO<sub>2</sub> acidifies the oceans. This combination can be deadly to marine life and affects us through decreases in fisheries catches and diversity of species, loss of tourism attractions such as diving and snorkeling, and increases in exposure to storms and other extreme events. In addition, as the ocean absorbs heat and CO<sub>2</sub>, its ability to moderate more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions actually reduces.</p>
<p>Many of the impacts of climate change on the oceans have already been recorded. Marine species ranging from plankton to fish, and marine mammals have shifted their distributions by tens to hundreds of kilometers per decade generally towards the poles, or to cooler waters, to find areas where they can survive as the ocean changes. Seasonality of biological events such as reproduction and migration are also altered. Ocean acidification has been shown to affect fish and shellfish from high latitudes to the tropics. These changes affect food web interactions between marine producers, grazers, and predators, creating new compositions of species that have not been seen in recent history. Additionally, marine biodiversity and ecosystems are already facing a multitude of threats from humans, including overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. These threats will add to, and even be exacerbated by, the impacts of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
<p>Today, sensitive and vulnerable ecosystems such as tropical coral reefs are taking the brunt of these impacts. Tropical coral reefs are particularly sensitive to the combination of CO<sub>2</sub> related stressors. Under heat stress, corals “bleach” by losing symbiotic algae that is essential for their survival. Ocean acidification makes it more difficult for corals to build calcium carbonate exoskeletons, making them amongst the most sensitive groups of organisms to ocean acidification. In some locations in the tropical oceans, such as in Papua New Guinea, CO<sub>2</sub> is naturally seeping out from the ground, providing a window for us to see what coral reefs ecosystem are like in a high CO<sub>2</sub> ocean. Coral reefs closer to these sites have substantially lower diversity of both corals and their associated species. Coral reefs provide critical habitats for tens of thousands of species. They are also important tourist attractions, and their fisheries are an important source of food and livelihood for coastal communities. Loss of coral reefs will thus threaten biodiversity, income, livelihood, and food security.</p>
<p>Fishermen’s catches in general are affected when distribution and abundance of the fish stocks shift. A study, conducted by colleagues and myself, analyzed the world’s marine fisheries catches since the 1970s. We developed an indicator to use fish catches as a “thermometer” that is based on the average temperature preferences of species in the fisheries catches. We found that the world’s catches have been increasingly dominated by warmer water species in the last four decades at a rate that is related to ocean warming, even after the effects of changes in fishing intensity have been accounted for.</p>
<p>The oceans will look substantially different in the future if we make different decisions on limitations of greenhouse gas emissions and ocean management. Under the “business-as-usual” scenario, and without major efforts in limiting emissions, temperatures in the surface layer of the ocean are expected to increase by 2.7<sup>o </sup>C from levels in the 1990s, and the ocean will acidify at a rate that is unprecedented over the past millions of years. Many marine organisms, from seagrass, coral reefs, and shellfish to fish and seabirds will be severely impacted. Fish stocks are projected to shift their distribution 65% faster towards the poles compared to a scenario in which we limit ocean warming below 1<sup>o </sup>C relative to the 1990s.</p>
<p>Climate change is expected to impact the tropical marine ecosystems the hardest, through a combination of loss of biodiversity, decreases in potential fisheries catches, sea level rises, and the inherent high dependence of many tropical countries and communities on marine ecosystems. The capacity to adapt to these impacts is relatively low. However, areas outside the tropics will not be safe from climate change impacts. Warming, ocean acidification, and the loss of sea ice are threatening polar ecosystems. Shifts in distribution of commercially important fish stocks are expected to lead to international fisheries conflicts. Some countries and communities may lose their traditionally or culturally important fisheries. In addition, given the globalized networks of seafood supply, decreases in catches in the tropics, of tuna, for example, will also impact markets far away from the sources.</p>
<p>Opportunities still exist that would allow us to substantially reduce these impacts. Limiting emissions to a less than 1<sup>o </sup>C warmth of the ocean going forward is necessary; otherwise, a substantially different ocean would result from any less-stringent emissions scenarios. Also, we need to implement all other measures to reduce the existing stresses on marine ecosystems, which will help reduce impacts from climate change. Efforts to rebuild ecosystems and biodiversity that have already been damaged (e.g., coral reefs) are needed. However, all these opportunities will disappear if we do not act quickly.</p>
<p>The ocean is a vital component of the Earth, supporting life in this planet and our own well-being. Any discussion about the sustainability of this planet, such as setting CO<sub>2</sub> emission limits or goals for sustainable development, must consider the oceans. Otherwise, such discussions will risk making inadequate decisions for the future of the planet.</p>
