								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a Chinese restaurant in a Las Vegas strip mall, Austin Ayer tries to act nonchalant as he orders the most controversial item on the menu.</p>
<p>“Do you want crab in your shark fin soup?” asks the waiter. “It tastes much better.”</p>
<p>“No, just shark fin,” says Ayer. “And I’d like it to go.”</p>
<p>The waiter takes measure of the strapping university student, who, with his blue eyes and rosy cheeks, perhaps doesn’t fit the description of a typical shark fin soup customer. The waiter shrugs: “That’ll be $21.57.” Ayer hands over a credit card. He slowly exhales at the ringing of the cash register.</p>
<p>Minutes later in the parking lot, Ayer opens the pint-sized styrofoam container and pours some soup onto a tray in his makeshift mobile genetics laboratory: the back of his Scion hatchback. He quickly gets to work before his shark fin samples are compromised. “I need to get this out of the hot broth and onto ice as soon as possible,” he says.</p>
<p>Fishing around with long metal forceps, he pulls out chunks of meat. “This looks like crab,” he says. “That’s not what we want.” He sets it aside and teases long, elastic, translucent noodle-like strips from the broth: they look like the tendons that give shark fins their strength. “This is looking better. Here we go.”</p>

(Credit: Kenneth R. Weiss)</p></div>
<p>He washes a few of the filaments with a squirt of distilled water and tucks them in a test tube with an enzyme solution for later genetic tests. If all goes well, the telltale DNA inside the stringy bits will reveal whether the soup contained shark species banned under international law.</p>
<p>Genetic identification has become faster, cheaper, and more reliable in recent years, with advances coming so quickly that even enterprising undergraduates like Ayer can now fashion themselves as DNA detectives. In the not-too-distant future, next-generation sequencing—which allows machines to read millions of gene sequences in one batch—and the promise of a rapid or instant DNA test will transform much of what we know about life in the sea and how fast we can know it.</p>
<p>Combined, these quantum jumps in technology will provide exacting ways to measure if the seafood supply is safe and honest, offer biologists new methods to track elusive endangered species, and empower regulators with instant forensic evidence to crack down on illegal wildlife trafficking or determine the species of fish caught in nets far from shore. And if breakthroughs continue apace, consumers will soon be able to deputize themselves as genetic gumshoes, testing the halibut on their plate to quickly determine if it really is halibut, no matter if it has been filleted, frozen, or fried.</p>
<p>At the center of this revolution is an ID system that uses a snippet of DNA sequence data that belongs to a particular species, with the ambition to build a digital catalogue that includes every species on Earth. These distinct sequences, named DNA barcodes after the familiar black and white stripes on products scanned at the supermarket, are stored on centralized databases. When researchers isolate the right DNA sequence from a new tissue sample, it can be compared to all identified species on file to see if it’s a match. So far, more than 11,000 fish have been ID’d and catalogued within the <a href="http://www.fishbol.org">Fish Barcode of Life</a> computerized repository. It’s part of a larger effort, the <a href="http://www.ibol.org/">International Barcode of Life</a> (iBOL), which has analyzed close to five million samples representing more than 525,000 different species on land and at sea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the race is on to provide a rapid DNA test that Paul Hebert, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Guelph in Ontario and scientific director of iBOL, likens to the handheld “tricorder” used on Star Trek to boldly scan and identify life forms throughout the sci-fi universe. “That’s the world we are heading to,” he says, “reading all forms of life like people read thermometers.” Having this futuristic handheld technology would shorten the time from sample to positive species ID, a system that now requires samples to be sent to a lab for processing and DNA sequencing before they can be compared to a database such as the Fish Barcode of Life.</p>

<p>In a reflective moment, Hebert acknowledges that Spock’s tricorder might not be a perfect comparison because it doesn’t require a tissue sample or even skin contact. “From that standpoint, it’s wrong technically,” he says. “You don’t have that much DNA floating in the air.”</p>
<p>That’s not a problem in the oceans. Fish and other marine creatures regularly slough cells in seawater, leaving telltale environmental DNA (eDNA) in the area that can be read through next-generation sequencing. By processing some water samples, Hebert says, the new technology can “read all of the species that have been in that water that day.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, for example, researchers released the results of the four-year seafaring Tara Expedition, which collected eDNA instead of museum specimens to glean new insights into the interactions of millions of species of plankton, from viruses to microscopic animals.</p>
<p>What’s remarkable is that until the 1970s, scientists didn’t know most of these microbes existed in ocean waters because they couldn’t see them, says Stephen R. Palumbi, a marine biologist at Stanford University<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>“Next-generation sequencing is one of the most astounding breakthroughs in biology in the past 20 or 30 years,” says Palumbi, adding that its potential is just beginning to emerge. Federal government researchers are using it to track elusive porpoises in Alaska and determine if rare spring-run Chinook salmon are making it into the headwaters of the Columbia River. Some scientists are collecting eDNA from ocean water to assess every species that lives in a marine reserve. Others are experimenting with paring eDNA, which identifies which fish are present, with acoustic data from fish-finding sonar to estimate their abundance. Such experiments seek a non-lethal way to survey fish populations, rather than traditional method of catching fish in a trawl net and counting them when they are dead.</p>
<p>It’s possible that one day soon, a fisheries manager who wants to check on commercial catch could rinse a fisherman’s net and scan the rinse water for a genetic signature of every kind of fish that had been caught. That’s on Palumbi’s long to-do list. “Extracting the data is easy,” he says. The hard part, he adds, is finding a commercial fisherman who will allow an outsider to wash his nets for genetic scrutiny.</p>
<p>Palumbi, who is also director of Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California, has been a pioneer in using genetics in marine biology, including taking the lab on the road. He and colleagues repeatedly set up a surreptitious DNA laboratory in a Tokyo hotel room throughout the 1990s that revealed how Japan’s whalers were violating international law by hunting and selling the meat of humpback, blue, gray, fin, and other great whales—far beyond their limited permit to take minke whales for “scientific research.”</p>

<p>Initially, their methodology and findings were denounced by the whaling industry, yet Japan’s government soon cracked down on contraband and mislabeled meat.</p>
<p>“When we started testing whale meat, the process was tedious and laborious,” Palumbi says. “All that is changing with the new technology. It’s easier, cheaper, and more reliable. A high school freshman could do it, if we showed her how.” But could he teach a journalist to do it?</p>

<p>My stint as a temporary lab tech began two months before I went shark fin shopping in Las Vegas with Ayer. I’m driving north toward Pacific Grove when my phone chirps with a text from Palumbi: “Don’t forget your homework.” It’s late and the sushi bars will be closing soon, thwarting my assignment to deliver fresh sushi for sequencing the next morning. A Japanese restaurant beckons from alongside the highway and I find myself sitting at a sushi bar directly beneath the stern gaze of a muscular sushi chef.</p>
<p>Palumbi has his students test their sushi as a primer to DNA sequencing. He says it’s remarkable how often salmon turns out to be trout, flounder gets sold as sand dab, various white fish are billed as cod, and red snapper, or even halibut, is switched out for cheaper farmed tilapia. Restaurants, especially sushi bars, are apparently the worst offenders. Palumbi’s instructions? Bring at least six different types of fish to the lab, and keep them fresh.</p>

(Credit: Kenneth R. Weiss)</p></div>
<p>I order the biggest sashimi platter on the menu, a colorful display of 24 slices of six kinds of fish, asking the chef to point out the various pieces on the plate. He rattles off the names so fast, it’s hard to keep track. As a self-styled sushi sleuth, I need to maintain chain of custody for each sample, getting the assigned names, so I can verify species by their genes. It’s impossible to catch the eye of the busy chef to pose a question, so I wave the menu and begin ordering side dishes. Each time he hands me a new plate, I hold up another piece of sashimi, asking, “What is this?” Soon he’s grumbling in Japanese. When I’m sure I’ve almost worn out my welcome, I give him a big smile and ask for a to-go container. He thrusts a styrofoam box at me without a word. I organize my catalogued specimens in the box, then push my luck and ask for a plastic bag filled with ice. He ignores my question and instead calls out to one of the servers, and, pointing to me, yells, “Check!”</p>
<p>The next morning, the Palumbi Lab emerges from the fog in the heart of the Hopkins Marine Station, which is perched on a rocky point overlooking the churning Pacific Ocean next to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The lab is already full of busy students by the time I arrive at 8:30 a.m. with my samples on ice.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day, I follow Palumbi’s tedious 19-step recipe for preparing tissues for DNA sequencing. It begins with tugging on purple gloves, and using sterile needles to dig out a tiny piece of fish flesh—smaller than a grain of rice—and easing it to a test tube filled with solution. It’s delicate work and, after a half-dozen of these sushi surgeries, I stick myself with a sharp needle and bleed all over the lab.</p>
<p>Aside from helping me staunch the bleeding, Palumbi is a hands-off instructor. First, I dose the samples with the enzyme proteinase K to chemically chew up the tissue and release the DNA. Then, I follow more than a dozen more steps before I load the tubes—now filled with clear liquid—into a sophisticated apparatus the size of a home bread machine where they’re “baked” with the chemical instructions to make thousands of copies of the tiny piece of DNA for easier identification.</p>
<p>All this has to happen before I can send my samples for sequencing. The results come back a few days later via email: each sample translated into a long string of the letters A, T, C, and G—abbreviations for the nucleotide bases that are the building blocks of DNA—each sequence between 570 and 650 characters long. It looks like a child has maniacally typed the letters in random fashion over and over. One by one, I cut and paste the results and enter them into the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) on the National Institute of Health website, to see what I had actually eaten. It takes only seconds to compare the sequences to all of the DNA data collected around the world.</p>

<p>The salmon checks out, as do most of the other pieces. Then I load up the sequence for the ono, also known as wahoo by sports fishermen who revere this bigtasty fish, and send it to BLAST. Six seconds later, I have my answer. It isn’t ono, but a snake mackerel called escolar that has earned the nickname “Ex-lax fish.” Italy and Japan have banned escolar because it contains gempylotoxin, an indigestible wax that can bring on violent cramping and orange diarrhea.</p>
<p>Escolar is often sold as white tuna or by other names in sushi bars, according to conservation organization Oceana’s genetic testing in 2013, which showed a third of seafood was mislabeled in American restaurants and markets. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not banned escolar, but advises against its sale. The FDA got more involved in seafood mislabeling in 2007, when toxic pufferfish from China was sold as monkfish, sickening people and sending at least one to hospital. Since then, it has installed DNA sequencing machines in nine regional laboratories, and set up its own DNA library of the 700 or so most commonly eaten fish—with each barcode tagged to a species identified by expert taxonomists. Rigorous chain of custody is required so federal investigators can prosecute fraudulent mislabeling with DNA evidence that will stand up in court.</p>
<p>Bait-and-switch tactics, such as substituting cheap Vietnamese farmed swai, similar to catfish, for more expensive “red snapper,” remains common among imports that now make up more than 90 percent of US seafood consumption. Federal inspectors struggle to keep up with the flow of fish, much of it arriving after being processed at sea and hard to visually identify. The DNA analysis helps, but the process can be slow and cumbersome as inspectors collect samples, bring them to regional labs and then wait—for days or longer—for the results.</p>

<p>“I would love to see a portable sequencer and rapid extractors,” says Jonathan R. Deeds, principal investigator of the FDA’s genetics project to combat fish fraud. In the meantime, the FDA has experimented with the University of Guelph’s <a href="//itunes.apple.com/us/app/lifescanner-fda-edition/id950330936?mt=8">Lifescanner App</a>, which could quickly transmit test results from inspectors carrying tablets or smartphones to regional labs and FDA headquarters once such rapid DNA tests become reality.</p>
<p>Government and private industry are racing to further technologies that will ultimately help to positively identify fish and other species by their genes on the spot. The US Army’s biosecurity labs at Fort Detrick in Maryland, for instance, are researching methods to instantly identify anthrax and other pathogens. And commercial biomedical research firms are working on the technology, hoping to cash in on quick diagnosis for common bacteria and viruses that plague human patients. There’s even an early version of a handheld unit, developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies in England.</p>
<p>A cottage industry has emerged, with genetic testing companies offering to help restaurants, fish mongers, and seafood distributors clean up their supply chain to avoid running afoul of the law or facing hefty fines. And some researchers are identifying more elaborate genetic markers that go beyond ID’ing the species to differentiate among various populations so scientists can determine where the fish are caught. A consortium of European researchers uses genetics to trace the geographic origin of cod, for instance, whether it’s caught legally or plundered from overfished waters.</p>
<p>Kathy Moore, forensic biologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Charleston, South Carolina, expects that eventually it will become cost-effective to identify genetic profiles for an individual high-priced fish, such as a big blue fin tuna—essentially having a DNA tag that will follow the fish from the boat to the plate. Moore, who works with a <a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ia/iuu/taskforce.html">presidential task force</a> to combat illegal fishing and seafood fraud, has spent decades helping prosecute sea turtle poaching cases, sometimes relying on little more than swabs of turtle blood off baseball bats, knives, and spears that were matched against NOAA’s own curated DNA database of protected species.</p>
<p>All these genetic tests are complex variations of what I am doing in the Palumbi Lab. During my day there, I work alongside Austin Ayer, who is diving into his shark fin science project. While I process my sushi dinner leftovers, he snips and prepares tiny pieces from fins left in the lab’s freezer from when Palumbi used to send his students to Chinatown in San Francisco to purchase shark parts for DNA identification. That was before California banned their sale in 2013, a reaction to the barbaric practice of cutting off a shark’s fins and throwing the writhing animal overboard to bleed to death. Shark populations have plummeted around the world, in large part to meet the demand for shark fin soup, a luxury dish in Chinese culture that has become a symbol of status and wealth.</p>
<p>Inspired by Palumbi’s success in shaking up the Japanese whaling industry, Ayer wanted to do something similar, but only had a summer to tackle a project for his senior honors thesis and still graduate on time. So he settled on trying to replicate the pioneering methods of a <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114844">study</a> published in February 2015 that showed that even in places where shark fin soup is legal, it often contains fins from sharks that are illegally traded. The study found fins of two types of hammerheads in soup purchased in the United States, and managed to identify seven out of eight types of endangered sharks—including whale sharks, basking sharks, and great whites—that are illegal to ship across borders without a permit.</p>

<p>Palumbi approved Ayer’s project. Yet one hurdle remained. When California banned possession of shark fins, getting samples was no longer a convenient matter. So to find the closest place that has a concentration of restaurants with customers willing to shell out handsomely for a high-priced status symbol in a small bowl, Ayer needs to cross state lines.</p>
<p>“I never thought I’d be going to Las Vegas,” he says, “to do field research in marine biology.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before Ayer picks me up along the eight-hour drive to Sin City, he calls every Chinese restaurant in Vegas he can find that reputedly sells shark fin soup. Few show shark fin soup on their online menus, yet, in reality, most of them offer it. Quietly. To those who ask. Prices range from US $20 to $300 a bowl. But would they sell it to him?</p>
<p>Ayer asks Palumbi for guidance, given that his professor has experience buying strange things from the sea for genetic analysis. “It won’t be the weirdest thing that happens in Las Vegas that night,” Palumbi advises him. He suggests that Ayer simply use his chopsticks at the table to pull out shark fin filaments and put them in test tubes. Ayer has another plan: “Ideally, we get as many orders to go as we can.”</p>
<p>The first test comes in the Chinese restaurant in the Vegas strip mall. It’s 37 °C and Ayer opens the restaurant’s double glass doors to a blast of air conditioning. The restaurant is nearly empty. “We are about to find out if this is going to work,” Ayer says under his breath.</p>
<p>After making a successful buy and processing the samples in the sunbaked parking lot, Ayer repeats the routine at another local establishment in Las Vegas’s Chinatown. Then he is ready to hit the Strip. Ayer calculates that his research grant will cover 11 soup samples, provided he limits himself to mid-range prices, nothing more than $70 a bowl. It’s time to go to a high-end joint where discriminating customers would insist that shark fin is the real deal.</p>

<p>Oversized chandeliers, obsequious waiters, and white tablecloths greet our arrival at Jasmine, the Chinese restaurant inside the Bellagio hotel and casino. Plush curtains and valances frame the window overlooking the lighted fountains that dance in the desert night to synchronized music. Shark fin is nowhere on the pricy menu. Ayer orders spring rolls to buy a little time.</p>
<p>When a waitress comes by, Ayer learns the restaurant offers three versions of the soup: the basic, for $60, and the deluxe with a two-ounce clump of shark fin tendons for $150, or a three-ounce clump for $180. Not a high roller, Ayer orders the basic</p>
<p>As soon as it arrives, Ayer receives a text from a friend who needs a pickup at the airport. He snags the server and asks for a to-go cup. The soup is whisked away and returned in a fancy white cardboard box with Bellagio’s looping serif logo. Within minutes, he’s processing the sample in the back of the Scion in the Bellagio’s stifling hot covered parking lot, breathing fumes of the trapped auto exhaust.</p>
<p>We’ve picked up Ayer’s friend and it’s getting late, but Ayer is hoping for one more sample. The Beijing Noodle No. 9 at Caesars Palace is just across the street. It’s almost closing time and the hostess does not want to seat us, but then a gregarious server wearing black-rimmed attitude glasses allows us inside, asking us to order quickly before the kitchen shuts down. He recommends the Singapore noodles and General Tso’s chicken. We accept, but Ayer also asks for shark fin soup. It isn’t on the menu, but the waiter confirms it’s available—a small bowl for $99 and a bowl with a fin for $199—but he has some advice: “Skip it. It’s not worth it. If you asked for it, I don’t think I’d sell it to you. They cut off the fin and let the shark die. It’s so mean.” Ayer skips it. The price is way out of his range.</p>
<p>We close down the Beijing Noodle, head to the Strip for a midnight beer, and then crash for the night at a budget motel. The next morning, we part ways and Ayer spends that day and evening collecting more soup and samples before making the long drive back to the Pacific Grove lab, two ice-packed coolers with his carefully preserved samples in the hatch.</p>

<p>In this forensic work, obtaining and preserving samples with intact DNA is critical: DNA degrades as tissues break down, shattering the long strands into smaller and smaller pieces until they are too short and fragmented to be useful. The challenge facing researchers scrutinizing shark fins is to find a short strand that will survive all of the insults—drying, bleaching, boiling in soup—but one that’s long enough so that they have the information needed to identify a specific species. By Monday morning, Ayer is struggling with the initial round of results from his Las Vegas samples, picking up DNA from other ingredients added for flavor. “There’s tons of DNA in the soup,” he tells me, “[but] half the time, it comes back as pig, or chicken, or crab, or shrimp.”</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, Ayer keeps working on the samples—extracting the DNA and sending it off for sequencing. The results? He was able to isolate enough genetic information to identify the species of shark from every soup he purchased. But one DNA barcode stood out from the rest. It came from a scalloped hammerhead, a warm-water shark so endangered that it has joined the list of species illegal to trade internationally. The discovery left him with mixed feelings of sadness and excitement. “It’s a double-edged sword,” Ayer says. “It’s a bummer to find endangered species. But it makes my project more compelling, a more interesting story to tell.”</p>
<p>The global demand for shark fin soup is driving scalloped hammerheads toward extinction. This shark, with its bizarre head shaped like a sci-fi spaceship, is targeted because its large fins are loaded with ropy strands of collagen that are prized by consumers. The restaurant probably had no idea it was serving the fin of an endangered shark. The distributor was also likely unaware, as were perhaps others in the supply chain that passed through Hong Kong, a hub of the global trade. Short of a global ban on shark fin soup, how can the sharks most threatened with extinction be saved? And can genetics play a role in the solution?</p>
<p>Palumbi considers genetics an insightful tool that can penetrate the most opaque aspects of the seafood market, whether properly identifying whale meat in a Tokyo display case, a box of fish fillets arriving on the docks in Los Angeles, or a fin swimming in a bowl of soup in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before we were blind,” Palumbi says, “but now we can see: DNA technology gives us a vision of what’s in that bowl of soup. Sometimes we find out bad things, but that makes us double down to fix those problems. It’s not just a bowl of soup, but a bowl with strands from an endangered species swirling around. And once we find that out, we can do something about it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Will there be a day when the seafood on your plate has been certified as sustainable, toxin-free and exploitation-free and has been tracked from the time it was hooked to the time it is purchased? Will this information be verified by satellites from the sky that have cross-referenced errant transmissions and have correlated them with reports from an at-sea observer? Will every flag-state inspect the fishing vessels under their jurisdiction for compliance with international regulations to prove clean ownership, transparent operations and vessel seaworthiness? Will conservation, followed by technology and innovation be the prime motivators within the fishing industry thereby reducing wastage and promoting conservation?</p>
<p>Today we are a long way from being able to answer even one of these questions in the affirmative, exposing the vast divide between the principles of the conventions being ratified at the United Nations and the practicality in achieving their goals. Why it is so hard – if not impossible – to achieve a positive response to all those questions? The case of one particular fishing vessel provides some clues.</p>
<div id="attachment_542" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/seashepherd.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-542" class="size-full wp-image-542" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/seashepherd.jpg" alt="The Atlas Cove, Bob Barker and Sam Simon, in pursuit of the poaching vessel, Thunder.

<p>Fishing in the Southern Ocean is regulated by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), one of the seventeen Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) that regulate fishing in various ocean regions across the world. In short, the RFMO consists of interested member countries that flag and operate vessels that fish under the conditions of RFMO permits and report back to ensure a complete feedback system is in place.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, a global market began to develop for Chilean Seabass and there was a rush to fish the rich waters of the Southern Ocean. By the mid-1990s, the illegal catch of Chilean Seabass outweighed those caught legally under CCAMLR, or under national jurisdiction. Strict actions were quickly taken under the CCAMLR to stamp out a bulk of the unsanctioned activity, but six vessels took advantage of legal loopholes and continued to illegally fish inside the controlled waters of the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>The <em>Thunder</em> was one such vessel. She had largely employed some, or all, of the measures listed below to remain beyond the full reach of the current law:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using Flags of Non Compliance: Flagging ships to non-member countries and thereby attaining the status of “Unregulated.” The <em>Thunder</em> flew the flags of Togo, Mongolia, Seychelles, Belize and Nigeria, none of them members of the CCAMLR.</li>
<li>Fishing in the high seas: Fishing in regions where no internationally binding laws apply and therefore acting outside the enforcement regime of the RFMO member-countries. Between 2006 and 2014, the <em>Thunder</em> was sighted a total of eighteen times. She was either fishing in or transiting through the high seas region of the CCAMLR management region.</li>
<li>Calling ports with relaxed enforcement regimes: Landing catch at ports with very relaxed port state controls in South East Asia and Africa, thus ensuring that the vessels are not inspected when landing their catch, while at the same time accessing port facilities to refuel, re-stock and change crew. The <em>Thunder </em>called ports in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Mauritius over the years. She was inspected in Malaysia in 2013 and was found to have on board a cargo of illegally caught Patagonian toothfish. The captain and crew of the <em>Thunder</em> were fined $AU90,000 &#8211; only a fraction of the $US60 million that Interpol estimated that ship’s owners have earned from the vessel’s illegal catch since 2006. Having paid the fine, the crew and ship were later released along with their illegal catch, and they subsequently returned to the Southern Ocean.</li>
<li>Employing additional techniques: Using the invisibility in the oceans to hide the true identity of the vessel by forging documents, hopping flags, changing names and operating under shell companies thereby hiding beneficial ownership. The <em>Thunder</em> swapped names between <em>Rubin, Typhoon I, Kuko, Wuhan No. 4, Ming No. 5</em><em>, </em>and over the years changed ownership at least seven times.</li>
</ol>

<p>Today the <em>Thunder</em> does not exist. She was found fishing illegally within the high seas of the Southern Ocean on December 17, 2014 by the marine conservation group, Sea Shepherd. Operating under the UN World Charter for Nature, Sea Shepherd is well known for its direct-action approach to conservation. With the mandate to uphold international conservation law, Sea Shepherd intervenes to stop environmental crimes that impact the marine environment, in situations where those responsible for law enforcement are unable to, or refuse to, uphold those laws.</p>
<p>Over the next 109 days, the <em>Thunder</em> remained on the high seas, traveling a distance of 10,000 nautical miles from the Southern Ocean to the Indian Ocean and round the Cape of Good Hope to the South Atlantic Ocean, effectively remaining outside the reach of the world’s navies. She moved freely despite being subject to a Purple Notice by Interpol and a reputation for being the world’s most notorious poacher. In early April 2015, the vessel was deliberately sunk by her captain in the waters of São Tomé and Príncipe, a tiny West African island country.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SQ71Y_g116A" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p><em>The</em> <em>Thunder</em> case study presents three distinct facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Illegal vessels do not hide behind a shroud of secrecy. In fact they exist because they remain beyond the full reach of the law.</li>
<li>The illegality within the fishing industry exists because of the maze of countries involved, most often with outdated legal instruments to keep pace with the current industry and a non-harmonization of regulations.</li>
<li>A woeful lack of enforcement and in proactive patrols exists on the world’s oceans. During a recent address in Chile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry sighted the case of the <em>Thunder</em> and commented that, “there are millions of square miles of oceans that are unregulated and that you have unscrupulous people who are chasing the money.” He further added, “The responsibility of pursuing pirate ships cannot be left to environmental groups,” highlighting a need for consensus on greater enforcement mechanisms.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <em>Thunder</em> case study highlights the importance of at-sea patrols. To achieve true marine conservation, the world needs an ocean governed by laws that can be monitored and enforced. Until lofty principles can be practicably enforced and the questions posed at the beginning of this article be affirmatively answered, on-the-scene enforcement, which stops crimes as they are taking place, remains the most effective tool to target illegal activity on the world’s oceans. And while regulatory grey areas, a lack of resources, and a lack of government will continue to plague maritime law, leading to ineffective enforcement on the high seas, organisations such as Sea Shepherd will continue to play a vital role filling this law enforcement gap.</p>
<p>Consequences for non-compliance must be swift and binding, as it is not the scale of the punishment, but the certainty of it that acts as the biggest deterrent to crime. Currently, the vastness of the high seas and overlaps and gaps between regional and international jurisdictional responsibilities remain a challenge to marine law enforcement. However, recent moves towards international cooperation on fisheries crimes indicate that momentum is building to tackle the challenges, head-on.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Easter Island is best known for its mysterious Moai statues, which dominate part of the hilly coastline and stare at the horizon like ancient watchmen of the once bountiful ocean. Just beyond the reach of their gaze lies a large stretch of open water, known as the high seas, that provides a vital spawning ground for many overfished and highly migratory species, including tuna and sharks.</p>
<p>The seas were once plentiful, notes Alberto Hotus, president of the Easter Island Elder’s Council, who fondly remembers when a fishing boat could easily bring back enough to feed the whole island. “[This] does not happen anymore,” he says with a hint of sadness. “There are no tuna, no fish.”</p>
<p>Residents of the island, also known as Rapa Nui, have long claimed that vessels are fishing illegally in their waters. Many local fishermen attest to seeing the distant glimmer of foreign vessel lights at night.</p>
<p>“People on the island have been complaining about illegal fishing for years,” says Marta Hotus, the governor of Easter Island. Evidence of these activities, such as buoys and long nets—fishing gear that is not used by the locals—even regularly washed ashore.</p>
<p>The Rapa Nui people once used their celestial-based navigation skills to “conquer the islands by navigating across the seas,” says Mayor Pedro Pablo Edmunds Paoa. He describes them as the “Phoenicians of the Pacific,” referring to the ancient Mediterranean civilization renown for having mastered deep-sea navigation, covering great distances in their ships of trade and war.</p>

<p>But the illustrious navigational past of the Rapa Nui alone is no match for the industrial scale of illegal fishing operations. Nor can it reverse the impact on the livelihoods of a community whose very survival has long been tied to the ocean’s bounty.</p>
<p>“What I see in the sea makes me sad because I see fishermen go out and come back with nothing,” says Sara Roe, president of the Hanga Piko fishing association on Easter Island. “Coming back with nothing means that they won’t have bread for their kids, there will be no food for the household, so that is a problem for the people.”</p>
<p>The case of Easter Island partly demonstrates the difficulties faced by governments in monitoring remote areas of the high seas, which in turn become fertile ground for illegal fishing operations. Governments around the world have recognized the scale of the problem and are seeking solutions, but their resources vary enormously.</p>
<p>What role can advances in technology play in putting an end to illegal activities on the high seas that pillage an estimated $23.5 billion worth of fish each year? Because, let’s face it &#8211; trying to look for illegal fishing activities taking place across an area covering half the planet is akin to looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>The answer, some companies say, is by monitoring the seas from the sky.</p>
<p>Stuart Martin, CEO of the U.K.-based firm Satellite Applications Catapult, says that satellite data is now playing a “key role” in helping to end illegal fishing activities. It’s also helping to make the protection of livelihoods in many villages a “reality rather than an idealistic goal.”</p>
<p>John Amos, president of the U.S. non-profit group SkyTruth, agrees. Satellite data and real-time vessel tracking, he says, is “evolving quickly” and “shining a light on the commercial fleet that has been operating largely out of sight since humans first sailed over the horizon.&#8221;</p>

<h2><strong>Out of sight, out of mind </strong></h2>
<p>Located some 4,000 kilometers (2,300 miles) west of Chile, Easter Island’s isolated location coupled with the vast size of its surrounding ocean makes it vulnerable to illegal fishing—a criminal activity taking place on a global scale, fueled in part by the assumption that no one is watching. With the advent of more affordable space-based satellite technologies and their pioneering integration into custom monitoring platforms, there are more eyes than ever on the sea.</p>
<p>“The big change in the last few years that will accelerate into the future is the reduced costs of launching and developing highly effective satellites. As the number and usefulness of satellites increases, more data is available for effective monitoring,” explains Brad Soule, Senior Fisheries Analyst at Catapult’s Ocean Sustainability Business Unit.</p>
<p>As the Rapa Nui community became increasingly concerned with threats to their ocean environment, so did conservation groups, who sought an innovative way to answer their call for greater protection. SkyTruth, an organization that specializes in satellite-based remote sensing technologies, was soon enlisted by The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Bertarelli Foundation to monitor and identify the best ways to protect the island’s waters.</p>
<p>The information compiled as part of the project prompted the Chilean Navy to increase its patrol efforts of the province. Likewise, in late 2015, the findings contributed to the announcement of a 631,368 square kilometers (243,630 square miles) marine park around the area, now considered to be the third-largest fully protected area of ocean in the world.</p>
<p>“In early 2012, Pew contacted us to ask if it was possible to monitor the activity of ships – including fishing vessels – in the waters of Easter Island Province,” said John Amos, an expert in using satellite images, aerial photographs and other kinds of remote sensing and digital mapping.</p>
<p>He had founded SkyTruth in 2001.</p>
<p>In January 2013, they began a monitoring program that used satellite radar images to detect the presence of ships, and satellite-collected Automatic Identification System (AIS) broadcasts to identify those vessels. At the time, this was the first instance of these two different technologies being combined in this way to monitor a country’s waters for illegal fishing activity.</p>

<p>Data collected between January and October 2013, including 163 satellite images, detected 73 vessels in and around Easter Island’s waters. Of these, 31 were identified using AIS (to include 22 cargo ships, 5 fishing vessels, 1 cruise ship, and 3 undefined). More than half (the remaining 42 vessels) could not be identified using their AIS broadcasts, but based on their size and location were determined by SkyTruth to be commercial fishing vessels. More than half of those vessels (a total of 25) were detected within Easter Island’s Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>
<h2><strong>Knowing where to look</strong></h2>
<p>“To stop illegal fishing and other crimes taking place on the ocean, authorities first need to be able to recognize and track vessels,” argues Pew’s Tony Long in his article “Satellite Tracking Can Unmask Illegal Fishing Vessels.” The former British naval commander now directs the organization’s <em>Ending Illegal Fishing Project.</em></p>
<p>Unlike mobile phones or cars, fishing vessels are not required to have an identification number. This means that identifying vessels at sea is not a straightforward exercise and requires the integration of differing but complimentary tools into a monitoring platform.</p>
<p>So how does it work?</p>
<p>The monitoring project conducted off Easter Island, for example, pioneered the combined use of two key tools—radar imagery and the Automatic Identification System (AIS)—to track and identify vessels.</p>
<p>Radar satellites can identify ships by beaming microwave (radar) energy down at the Earth’s surface and collecting the energy that is reflected back toward the satellite. According to SkyTruth’s Amos, steel-hulled ships are “strong reflectors of microwave energy and appear as very bright targets or radar images of the ocean.”</p>
<p>This allows for the observation of vessel activities without their participation or knowledge, an especially vital tool for ships that deliberately switch off their transceivers in order to avoid detection or don’t have them installed.</p>
<p>These radar images can yield basic information, including the exact location of a vessel at the moment the image was acquired, its approximate size and in some cases, the direction it’s moving. “But there is little information in a radar image that allows us to identify the vessel, or determine if it’s a fishing vessel rather than a cargo ship or other type of ship,” says Amos.</p>

<p>To fill the gap, SkyTruth combined radar satellite imagery with a second monitoring component known as a satellite-collected Automatic Identification System (AIS)—a form of automatic transceiver similar to a global positioning system (GPS) that is broadcast by vessels. Unlike other transceivers, such as the government-controlled Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), AIS was not designed for monitoring purposes. Instead it’s primarily used to prevent vessels from colliding at sea.</p>
<p>The use of AIS transceivers, however, is a relatively new approach in the fight against illegal fishing. “I think that AIS has only recently started to be used because it was not designed for fisheries monitoring purposes,” says Brad Soule from Catapult, adding that the number of satellites available for monitoring AIS do make it a useful tool for other maritime domain awareness purposes as long as you “account for some of the security issues that have already been addressed in traditional vessel monitoring systems.”</p>
<p>Collecting the AIS data was only the first step towards building a more accurate picture of the types of activities and behavioral patterns of vessels in Easter Island waters, as it’s the actual correlation and overlaying of data sources which facilitates the identification of vessel types.</p>
<h2><strong>Tracking vessels that don’t want to be tracked</strong></h2>
<p>Despite huge advances in satellite monitoring technology, “it can still be rigged to fool its users, and AIS and VMS are no different,” states Tony Long from Pew. Effective use of vessel tracking systems to detect illegal fishing activities therefore requires an understanding of how vessels circumvent the system in order to go unnoticed. Moreover, it’s vital that users have a thorough understanding of the differing behavior patterns and movements between cargo vessels and fishing vessels when monitoring their tracks on a screen.</p>
<p>Off the coast of Easter Island, SkyTruth collected AIS data that revealed distinct patterns of vessel movement and enabled the detection of suspected illegal activity. For example, vessels that move very slowly and frequently change directions are typically engaged in fishing activities, whereas those moving in straight lines at a steady speed are more likely to be cargo ships moving between South America and Asia.</p>
<p>Vessels that aren’t broadcasting AIS signals could be deliberating switching them off to avoid detection, but Amos says that this lack of signal could also result from gaps in orbiting satellite coverage.</p>
<p>To ensure continued monitoring coverage, SkyTruth regularly collected radar satellite imagery to see if any vessels appeared to be operating in Easter Island waters that were not broadcasting an AIS signal. “In many cases,” says Amos, “we could not find any AIS signals for vessels that appeared on the satellite imagery.”</p>
<p>So who were these vessels?</p>
<p>Amos calls them the <em>dark fleet</em>: vessels that “operate in stealth by not publicly broadcasting their identity.” In other words, vessels likely to be carrying out illegal fishing activities.</p>
<p>“In the remote waters of Easter Island,” Amos says, “we can assume a vessel larger than 20 meters that is not broadcasting AIS is probably a commercial fishing vessel.”</p>

<h2><strong>Keeping one step ahead</strong></h2>
<p>As demonstrated by the Skytruth study—where over half of the vessels monitored did not transmit an AIS signal—illegal fishing vessels are increasingly aware that they are being monitored through their safety and anti-vessel collision transceiver.</p>
<p>Even transceivers which are designed for monitoring purposes, such as the government enforced Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), face the challenge of having the devices tampered with once installed. VMS is not applied universally and the mandatory ping rate varies per country, with most setting it at every 1- 2 hours. Experts recommend a ping rate of multiple times per hour in order to capture 100% of fishing locations.</p>
<p>With illegal fishing operations increasingly becoming aware of how the current traditional monitoring systems can be fooled, how reliable is the data being generated for analysts?</p>
<p>“It’s a good question and an important one,” says Soule from Catapult.</p>
<p>“AIS was never designed for fisheries and marine reserve monitoring. It is only recently that it has become a useful tool by virtue of the growth in the number of fishermen who want to demonstrate transparency and compliance in their operations. But you are right, by itself AIS is not a panacea without an understanding of the vessels’ identities and thereby likely activities in the context of the area of operation and specific jurisdictions.”</p>
<p>Adding information from another transceiver is one way to help build a more accurate picture.</p>
<p>“We also use vessel monitoring system (VMS) data, when it is made available, to monitor the activities of fishing vessels,” says Soule. One of the marked differences between AIS and VMS, is that the latter can be required by governments or vessel owners and do not broadcast positions publicly.</p>
<p>An experienced fisherman from a North African country explained that one way around collecting more accurate VMS data would be for governments to require vessels to have their systems on two weeks before the fishing season begins. This would “allow for better control, ahead of season” and provide a better understanding of that vessel’s behavior patterns.</p>
<p>Beyond the use of positional data relayed by transceivers to monitor specific areas, the addition of a variety of sensors, “including satellite radar and optical imagery” is also a key data component to detect the presence of vessels, explains Soule.</p>
<p>This year, the U.S. government plans to further develop an application to assist in detecting ocean vessels in countries including Indonesia and the Philippines, using the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), another form of space-based sensor. VIIRS is capable of detecting lights—including from boats that use lights to attract fishery catch at night—in order to target potentially illegal activities.</p>
<p>Advances are also being made in the speed at which the merging of data is being processed, which is a huge step forward in providing real time coverage of remote areas, especially when working in tandem with authorities who can deploy patrols to carry out further investigations.</p>
<p>“Previously it took a team of analysts 18 hours or more to analyze the data and be able to find a vessel of interest. This system brings together all of those datasets in less than 18 milliseconds,” explains Nick Wise, head of Catapult’s Ocean Sustainability business unit.</p>
<p>The new system in question is the recently launched Project Eyes on the Sea, a maritime monitoring and surveillance data platform that was developed in partnership with Catapult and the Pew Charitable Trusts.</p>
<div id="attachment_533" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-533" class="size-full wp-image-533" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room.jpg" alt="Catapult operation room (Credit: Jennifer Gillam)" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room.jpg 900w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Catapult-Operation-room-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-533" class="wp-caption-text">Catapult operation room (Credit: Jennifer Gillam)</p></div>
<p>This platform uses and merges multiple sets of data, including Vessel Monitoring Data (government collected data), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, optical imaging as well as AIS, and has been designed to enable enforcement efforts to focus on specific problem areas and vessels, cutting in time and money.</p>
<p>“We consider anything that provides a position, an identity, and some behavioral information—or any combination of these, and bring together many data sources that don’t usually exist in the same system,” explains Soule, adding that the system enables an analyst to “know where to look next.”</p>
<p>In the future, it will be able to merge and incorporate other sources of information third-party surveillance and crowd-sourced images that could originate from any person, ship, aircraft, or unmanned vehicle. Despite recent technological advances in monitoring, the high seas—an area representing two-thirds of the world’s ocean—remain notoriously difficult to monitor and patrol for illegal fishing activities. Less than one percent of the open ocean is accorded protection.</p>
<p>“At the moment, the high seas are the weakest link because of their poor management and lack of governance,” explains Professor Alex Rogers of Somerville College, Oxford.</p>
<h2><strong>Future ocean surveillance: What’s on the horizon? </strong></h2>
<p>Advanced technologies, remote surveillance tools, and satellite monitoring of the high seas have long been accessible to the military, as well as (though to a much lesser degree) governments, fisheries management agencies, and private companies such as international couriers. Since 2013, however, an important shift has taken place towards increasing access to satellite data, and also understanding the gaps in data which allow for illegal vessels to circumvent whatever moderate level of monitoring was taking place to avoid detection.</p>
<p>However, for all the progress made, satellite-based technological advances alone cannot be relied upon to curb illegal fishing or monitor newly protected areas on the high seas.</p>
<p>Nor is space-based monitoring not without its own evolutionary problems, as it “requires significant computational horsepower to bring the data together and compare the different sources to identify abnormalities,” according to Soule.</p>
<p>Satellite-based technological advances greatly reduce the human power needed to process vast quantities of data and are likely to become fully integrated into monitoring platforms ten years from now. As satellite coverage of transceivers expands and more and more governments require vessels to install them, however, they are unlikely to be relied upon alone.</p>
<p>Vessel ID registration is still not mandatory in all regions, which means that unlike traffic offenses on a speed camera, it will take some time before we have a global or even regional database linking a vessel’s ID to a tracking system, although huge progress is being made in national waters.</p>
<p>In the future, illegal fishing practices may also be curbed by the universal and mandatory application of electronically tracking fish at points of catch and sale, a regulation that an increasing amount of regional fisheries organizations are moving towards. In the long run, this is likely to shrink the market for illegal catches.</p>
<p>Today, on-site enforcement action and regular patrols in the air, at sea, and in ports, coupled with prosecution for crimes committed remain vital components in the global fight against illegal fishing.</p>
<p>Twenty years from now, however, if autonomous anti-collision drone technology continues to evolve at the predicted rate, future high-seas satellite monitoring platforms are likely to integrate this aerial surveillance tool not only as a key monitoring feature, but also one that expedites enforcement.</p>
<p>The current reality, however, is that policing remote areas of the open ocean is left in most instances to governments who have neither the means nor the human resources to properly enforce existing regulations in such remote locations. Overcoming such challenges may well require the increased use of satellite and autonomous aerial surveillance technologies &#8212; bridgingthe gap between sea and sky in a very modern way.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists in South Africa are using ocean robots to study the unexpected and complex interplay between the Southern Ocean and the Earth’s changing climate.</p>
<p>The researchers have been inspired by the fact that this is the least studied part of the planet and yet one of the most dynamic and difficult to understand. It’s also an area of high species abundance and diversity, where common and highly specialized species both thrive.</p>
<p>The Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observatory (SOCCO) research team under the South Africa’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has been using robotics to observe the upper ocean’s physical processes and study their impacts on carbon dioxide exchange between the atmosphere and ocean, as well as on the growth of phytoplankton – microscopic algae that live in the surface ocean.</p>
<p>Local experts say these cutting-edge robotic gliders will shape the future of marine research and environmental monitoring of the Southern Ocean and South African waters. They hope that the data they gather will reveal how human activity is changing the planet.</p>
<p>What is known, SOCCO researchers say, is that the Southern Ocean accounts for fifty percent of all carbon dioxide absorbed by the oceans. This part of the world’s ocean is particularly sensitive to climate change because the creatures living here are susceptible to minor environmental shifts, which can lead to large changes in global ocean currents or ecosystem health.</p>

<p>“Our one research gap that we hope to address with these gliders, in conjunction with satellites and computer models, is better understanding the role of small scale features (such as ocean eddies and currents) and short term events (storms) on the overall state of the ocean,” says Dr. Sebastian Swart, CSIR’s principal scientist.</p>
<p>“Before glider technology was available, we were unable to measure these forms of features and variability – research ships and satellite data alone were not enough to investigate this,” he says.</p>
<h2><strong>Diving new depths</strong></h2>
<p>The first Southern Ocean glider deployments began in September 2012 near the remote Gough Island, about 2000 kilometres south west of Cape Town. For six months, gliders collected and sent data back from one of the world’s harshest environments directly to scientists at CSIR.</p>
<p>Operators based in South Africa used satellite communications to remotely control the location and depth of the robots. Since then, additional long-endurance robotics experiments have taken place in the Southern Ocean on an annual basis.</p>
<p>“Enhancing our understanding of how the Southern Ocean works and interacts with climate today will leave us in a position to better mitigate against the effects of climate change tomorrow,” says Swart.</p>
<p>The robotic glider fleet currently has nine units in total – a number that is expected to increase with the growing need of the global research community for reliable data collecting platforms that can withstand these inhospitable ocean environments. Four are surface wave gliders, which ride the ocean surface measuring CO₂, acidity, and other physical variables of the surface ocean. The other five are profiling gliders that can dive to a maximum depth of one kilometre below the ocean surface.</p>

<p>During each deployment, the gliders “tweet” data via satellite to scientists in Cape Town where it is stored, analysed and eventually made available to the global research community.</p>
<p>According to Swart, CSIR researchers are able to combine the analysis of data from surface wave and profiling gliders by pairing them together while deployed in the ocean to give a complete picture of changes in the water.</p>
<h2><strong>Tailor-made technology </strong></h2>
<p>The gliders are maintained in Cape Town at the CSIR-led South Africa Marine Engineering and Robotics Centre (SAMERC) in partnership with a marine technology company called Sea Technology Services.</p>
<p>Manufactured in the US, the gliders are modified to suit local needs when they get to South Africa.</p>
<p>“This includes adding new sensors, building new sensors for gliders and ships, refurbishing and maintaining the gliders,” says Swart who has been deeply involved in building the robotic ocean glider program in South Africa.</p>
<p>Swart says a team of South African marine engineers and engineering students at SAMERC have been trained to use the ocean gliders – a unique and advanced skill that can be expanded across the rest of the continent. A string of development programs have already been lined up. Each year young black South African engineers are trained on this advanced ocean technology, particularly the use of robots and scientific sensors. More importantly, Swart says, young marine scientists are graduating from the country’s universities.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Swart’s current team, the gliders have been instrumental in measuring ocean hydrography, chemistry and optics.</p>
<p>“More specifically they measure CO₂ exchange between the ocean and atmosphere as well as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, light levels, bio-optical properties of the water and weather such as wind, air temperature and humidity,” Swart says.</p>
<p>The gliders are sent out to collect more data from the severe Southern Ocean environment each year.</p>
<p>“We are just beginning our fourth significant Southern Ocean robotics experiment,” says Swart revealing that the research is designed to observe the full seasonal cycle of the upper ocean and its physical-biological processes.</p>
<p>Four gliders were recently deployed from the <em>SA Agulhas II</em>, South Africa’s Antarctic research vessel, in the frigid and stormy winter sea.</p>
<p>“We hope these gliders will continue making measurements until late summer time in 2016 or approximately a year in total,” he says. “They provide measurements that can be used to improve models and forecasts of the oceans and weather.”</p>
<p>Swart’s team has also conducted experiments offshore of Port Elizabeth – the site of a strong current along South Africa’s east coast. Led by CSIR’s Dr. Marjolaine Krug in April 2015, the six-week project showed that it was possible, but challenging, for the gliders to navigate and collect data in areas dominated by strong currents.</p>
<h2><strong>Boosting ocean research</strong></h2>
<p>At the University of Cape Town’s Nansen-Tutu Centre for Marine Environmental Research (MARE), research and development in ocean prediction, and using measurements of the oceans from satellites, is done.</p>
<p>Dr. Björn Backeberg, oceanographic researcher and co-director of the Nansen-Tutu Centre says that in order to predict ocean currents, ocean models must be combined with ocean observations in order to limit model errors at the nowcast stage (i.e. today), providing a better estimate of the ocean state.</p>
<p>“Ocean prediction is an initial condition problem, so if we can improve our ocean state estimate at the nowcast stage, then we improve our forecast skill for tomorrow, the day after and next week,” he says.</p>
<p>The data collected from satellites controls ocean models in a process called data assimilation, Backeberg says, satellites only measure the ocean surface, thus information about the ocean interior is missing.</p>
<p>He says that to obtain measurements of the ocean interior, researchers have historically relied on measurements gathered by ships, but this form of data collection is incredibly expensive due to the large running costs of the ships.</p>
<p>To hire the research vessel<em>, SA Agulhas II</em>, it costs approximately 300,000 rand (over 23,000 USD) a day. The daily rate for a deployed glider instead is far less – about 3,000 rand (approximately 232 USD).</p>

<p>“Robots, or autonomous platforms, such as gliders and Argo profiling floats are a much more cost effective way of collecting data, especially in remote regions that have severe weather and ocean conditions, such as the Southern Ocean,” he says.</p>
<p>Backeberg says robots are able to collect high resolution information for periods up to six months, depending on battery power, and can provide consistent data throughout the year. Keeping a ship at sea for three months is comparatively much more expensive and observations were generally more sporadic in both space and time.</p>
<p>“Assimilating these types of observations in ocean models as well as using them to validate our ocean model will help improve our ability to predict the oceans more accurately,” he adds.</p>
<h2><strong>The future of marine conservation?</strong></h2>
<p>Wider applications for these cost-effective robots are already being seen in the fields of ocean governance and resource management, and gliders are being used to monitor fish stocks and patrol the ocean for any signs of illegal activity.</p>
<p>Backeberg adds that the gliders are also beginning to assist in fish stock assessments. The information collected by these robots is providing a vital component to our understanding of fish stock health, fish migration and distribution patterns.</p>
<p>But there are limitations.</p>
<div id="attachment_380" style="width: 938px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mm.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-380" class="size-full wp-image-380" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mm.jpg" alt="A newly acquired CO2 measuring wave glider being transported in Cape Town%2c South Africa before deployment into the Subantarctic Zone (Credit: SOCCO)" width="928" height="541" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mm.jpg 928w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mm-300x175.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-380" class="wp-caption-text">A newly acquired CO2 measuring wave glider being transported in Cape Town, South Africa before deployment into the Subantarctic Zone (Credit: SOCCO)</p></div>
<p>“[The gliders] rely on acoustic measurements to estimate fish stock sizes. But acoustic measurements are unable to tell you what type of fish is being monitored. To do that you would still rely on ship measurements and stock assessment trawls,” he says.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, Backeberg backs the use of intelligent technology in conjunction with existing methods to monitor the ocean.</p>
<p>“Unmanned robots may be an important component of future marine conservation, but they will need to be used in combination with ship surveys and satellite measurements.”</p>
<p>Huge economic benefits are also in store.</p>
<p>Swart says efforts to improve ocean governance and resource management through technology will be able to feed directly into South Africa’s initiative to unlock the potential of its “blue” economy, dubbed <em>Operation Phakisa</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Phakisa</em> programme was launched in October 2014 by South African president Jacob Zuma to maximise the enormous economic potential of oceans while preserving them.</p>
<p>Ocean activity contributed 54 billion rand to South Africa’s economy and accounted for approximately 316,000 jobs in 2010, according to the government figures.</p>
<p>Swart sees the success of glider research missions potentially leading to economic growth.</p>
<p>“Gliders are a key part of unlocking the wealth of our ocean blue economy,” he says. “They can assist in understanding the ocean, protecting and managing its resources, and manage disasters and pollution.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Making impactful, visual indicators of our changing climate isn’t an easy task. Climate change is a gradual process, so it’s difficult to visibly show people what’s happening. Our oceans are changing, but we don’t notice the centimeter waters have risen or the amount they’re acidifying. But coral bleaching and reef decline are capturable: There are stark visual differences between thriving coral reefs and ones that have bleached as a result of warming oceans.</p>

<div style="width: 784px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/coral2.png" alt="" width="774" height="371" /><p class="wp-caption-text">American Samoa, April 2015 (Photo credit: XL Catlin Seaview Survey)</p></div>
<p><a href="http://underwaterearth.org/#page-1">Underwater Earth’s XL Catlin Seaview Survey</a> is making stunning panoramic images of coral reefs. Think of it as the oceanic version of Google Street View. With hundreds of thousands of photos taken already, the survey is globally documenting reef health and making the data it’s collecting along the way widely available to the public. Corals are declining one to two percent each year, so photographing this loss could help the world see what’s at stake.</p>
<p>Founded in 2010 by a group of former advertisers, Underwater Earth’s mission is to increase ocean literacy by taking captivating images of the world’s reefs. “Our goal was to collect ocean imagery to engage people in ways there weren’t possible before,” says Richard Vevers, Executive Director of the XL Catlin Seaview Survey and CEO of Underwater Earth.</p>
<p>People pause when they see these images–they understand that a white reef looks empty. Photos of ghostly white coral skeletons in American Samoa captured public attention earlier this year. The survey recorded a healthy reef there in December 2014 and then came back a few months later to document an extensively bleached one.</p>
<div id="attachment_20" style="width: 445px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasurvey.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20" class="wp-image-20" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasurvey-300x187.png" alt="seasurvey" width="435" height="271" srcset="https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasurvey-300x187.png 300w, https://www.futureoceans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/seasurvey.png 643w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-20" class="wp-caption-text">Flowerpot Rocks, American Samoa, December 2014 (left) and February 2015 (right); (Photo credit: XL Catlin Seaview Survey)</p></div>
<p>“Oceans are like a veneer that provides us with life on earth. It’s oxygen, food, and weather–that’s why people need to understand the implications of ocean change,” says Vevers. Up to 80 percent of carbon dioxide could be absorbed by oceans, so they really are the focal point of climate change.</p>
<p>By working with Google, the largest online communicator, the photos are now the most viewed underwater images in history. Some have been viewed by millions of people after being linked to Google’s homepage. The survey has taken over 750,000 images in 26 countries, but Google hosts a smaller curation of the panoramas on <a href="http://www.google.com/maps/streetview/#oceans">Oceans Street View</a>.</p>
<p>“Google provides a platform for organizations like Underwater Earth, NOAA and Mission Blue, who know the stories and issues best, to use our technology to tell their story,” says Jenifer Austin, manager of Google’s Ocean Program.</p>
<p>The survey is funded by the specialty insurance group XL Catlin. It’s no surprise that insurance companies are paying close attention to the effects of climate change given the economic costs of more frequent and intense natural disasters.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m0!3m2!1sen!2sfr!4v1448384619751!6m8!1m7!1socgCD5dOU64AAAQo8A3lQQ!2m2!1d-14.2591333161759!2d-169.5003055184385!3f180.52024213220255!4f-11.97090933730766!5f0.4000000000000002&amp;w=600&amp;h=450" height="450" width="100%"></iframe></p>
<p>To create each panoramic image, divers take a photo every two meters and can cover about 6 kilometers each day. Three images are taken simultaneously to get the 360 degree panoramic photos all while recording metadata like temperature, time, depth, and coordinates. Once the data is processed over the course of a few weeks, it can be uploaded to the Underwater Earth website using the <a href="http://www.google.com/maps/about/partners/businessview/apply/">Google Business photography program</a>.</p>
<p>They’re taking more than just pretty pictures, though. A technology similar to facial recognition systems that was developed by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography can assess the health of corals in each image. Without that technology, it could take a person months to go through as many images and it would be less precise than the 90 percent accuracy the recognition system has. What’s more is that all of the data collected about reef conditions is publicly <a href="http://globalreefrecord.org/data">available online</a>, so scientists can use it anytime.</p>
<p>Since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch program released its predictive bleaching tools this year, the survey has the ability to photograph a reef before and then after a major bleaching event. Coral Reef Watch sounds the alarm with its predictive maps up to months in advance and the survey goes in to take a firsthand look at the bleaching. Field scientists can then layer data about local conditions on these images to share information about what’s happening to the reef.</p>
<p>Closely watching these bleached reefs has scientific value too. By documenting resilient reefs with high recovery rates, scientists can show that reefs have a better chance of survival when human stressors are limited. Local managers can then use the images and data analysis to gain support for marine conservation.</p>
<p>“Better management and marine policy allows us to buy enough time for reefs to potentially repopulate and adapt. That’s the real reason we need measures in place to control local conditions,” says Vevers. “If we continue business as usual, we’ll lose most corals by 2050.”</p>
<p>What’s next for the CSS? For now they’re working on documenting all six coral reef regions in the world and then revisiting them every four to five years to see how they’re changing. If there’s a big storm, such as a major cyclone in the Great Barrier Barrier Reef, they’ll go assess the damage. Underwater robots might come somewhere down the line too.</p>
<p>Underwater Earth and Google are also working on more outreach. They’re setting up educational programs to take school children, media professionals, and stakeholders on virtual dives–places they might not otherwise see. The imagery is already being used in classrooms with <a href="https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/">Google Expeditions</a>.</p>
<p>“The potential of this partnership is huge. That a small non-profit partner could leverage our mapping technology to reach a large global audience and millions of people is unparalleled,” says Austin.</p>
<p><iframe width="760" height="428" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4C5EGXqgx8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>It’s clear Underwater Earth is raising public awareness about coral bleaching and the importance of reefs to livelihoods. And, partnering with Google has certainly furthered the reach of the project and might help lead to future policy changes too. To gain support for marine conservation, world leaders must be able to see what’s at risk if we don’t limit human stressors. Underwater Earth is providing the visuals to do just that.</p>
